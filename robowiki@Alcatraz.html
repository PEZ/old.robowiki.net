<p>
I'm 18, in college, and living in Pennsylvania in the United States. I've been following <a href="robowiki@Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a> for about 4 years.
<p>
<H4>Bots:</H4>

<p>
Competitive Megabot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li><a href="robowiki@Cyanide" class=wikipagelink>Cyanide</a> - My first <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> bot and best overall bot; as of October '05 it was #7 in the RR@H.
<li><a href="robowiki@Immortal" class=wikipagelink>Immortal</a> - My first good bot, it currently features a semi broken <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> mechanism; best ranking: #13 in the RR@H.
<li>Virgin<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Virgin" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - This bot doesn't really have a point, it's neither very original nor very good. As of June '05 it was ranked in the 60s in the RR@H.
<li><a href="robowiki@Calliope" class=wikipagelink>Calliope</a> - The most downloaded bot on the Repository, though that's due to a bug. This was my first even relatively competitive bot.
</UL>
<p>
Competitive Minibot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li>Cyprus<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Cyprus" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - A minibot in the 80's of RR@H as of June '05. It has had various lukewarm reincarnations.
</UL>
<p>
Competitive Nanobot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li><a href="robowiki@Freddie" class=wikipagelink>Freddie</a> - The top nanobot by a good margin as of October '05. It switches between two movement types, one that avoids HeadOnTargetting<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=HeadOnTargetting" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and one that avoids LinearTargetting<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=LinearTargetting" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.
<li>Guppy<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Guppy" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - A very mediocre nanobot that can beat some of the top nanos, but not many of the others.
</UL>
<p>
Competitive Robot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li><a href="robowiki@Krazy" class=wikipagelink>Krazy</a> - This is my <a href="robowiki@ExtendsRobot" class=wikipagelink>ExtendsRobot</a> bot. It is the consistent runner up in the <a href="robowiki@ExtendsRobotCompetition" class=wikipagelink>ExtendsRobotCompetition</a> that I occasionally run.
</UL>
<p>
Competitive NGBot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li><a href="robowiki@CeramicFish" class=wikipagelink>CeramicFish</a> - My first bot made with the <a href="robowiki@RobocodeNG/Archive" class=wikipagelink>[RobocodeNG]</a> mods. It currently uses the UVLaser and beats all of the <a href="robowiki@SampleBots" class=wikipagelink>SampleBots</a>.
</UL>
<p>
Retired Nanobot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li>Fury<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Fury" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - My first nanobot, I gave up on it eventually.
<li>Furious<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Furious" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - When I started on Fury again, I renamed it Furious.
<li>Mercury<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Mercury" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - A never very good nanobot that changed from a WallRider<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=WallRider" class=wikipageedit>?</a> to a <a href="robowiki@SpinBot" class=wikipagelink>SpinBot</a> to a PicoBot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=PicoBot" class=wikipageedit>?</a> to a <a href="robowiki@HaikuBot" class=wikipagelink>HaikuBot</a> and back.
<li>Eddie<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Eddie" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - Was a very good nanobot for awhile, but never won any competitions.
</UL>
<p>
Other Bot(s):
<p>
<UL >
<li>Axraelic<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Axraelic" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - Attempts to steal the movement of a top bot, save it, and use it against other bots. Fails.
<li>Azrael<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Azrael" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - Acts differently on every computer, but is consistantly bad.
<li>Vendetta<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Vendetta" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - Claim to fame? Was the original name of ms.Ares, the bot which won the beginner level of the official Robocode Rumble.
<li>Vengeance<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Vengeance" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - My only bot that attempts to succeed in melee. It doesn't. 
<li>Sierra<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Sierra" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - A team of spinbots.
</UL>

I'm happy to see you making yourself visible on the wiki! I almost get tears in my sentimental eyes when I think back on when I started Robocoding and a few months from that and your bot <a href="robowiki@Calliope" class=wikipagelink>Calliope</a> was always amongst my test bots. It took quite a while before I could beat it. I think it was when I added <a href="robowiki@VirtualGuns" class=wikipagelink>VirtualGuns</a> that I finally did it. I still like the agressiveness of that bot and the way it went from oscillating movement to a kind of stop-and-go. It was <a href="robowiki@Calliope" class=wikipagelink>Calliope</a> that made me realize that it must be possible to save data between rounds. Do a bit of ego-surfing on the wiki. Use the search function and search for "Calliope" =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Always nice to know that a bot of mine was good for something, and that movement especially. Thanks <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>. But my fondest memory of good ol' <a href="robowiki@Calliope" class=wikipagelink>Calliope</a> would have to be the days that the Repository's download count for her randomly jumped a thousand or so downloads. Staying on the 'Most Popular' list for months was good for the ego too... -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
=) It was the download count that made me download it in the first place. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I think it probably has the highest official download count to date.  <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a> once got a magical 2900 downloads, and I think Cigaret did, too, but <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a> has since reverted.  Just because it appeared to be a popular bot, though, it's been downloaded at least twice as much as any of my other bots, through no accomplishment of its own (It's among the hardest to hit nanos, but I now have the #2 ranked nano, the #1 ranked mini, and the #2 ranked megabot on the ER). -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
I also used <a href="robowiki@Calliope" class=wikipagelink>Calliope</a> as one of my test bots; great fun to test against, win or lose. When I first downloaded it, it wasn't because it had a high download count, but rather because people were talking about it in the forums, although they may have just been talking about it because it had such a high download count :D. Congrats on <a href="robowiki@Immortal" class=wikipagelink>Immortal</a> being in the 20s; I'm still out in the 60s with <a href="robowiki@Fractal" class=wikipagelink>Fractal</a>... -- <a href="robowiki@Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>
<p>
What about Guppy, your last (till now) original Robocode bot?  --<a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Oh, right. That one was no good. All I was trying to make was a bot that beat Nanis<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=Nanis" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and <a href="robowiki@Freddie" class=wikipagelink>Freddie</a>, and it did, but it lost to far too many other nanos. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Hey! A fellow Pennsylvanian! I hadn't realized before that there were other people on the wiki from within a few hours of me. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
Yeah, I am originally from near Philadelphia but currently out in Pittsburgh. Being here for the Super Bowl was depressing. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Yeah, i saw that your post earlier was from CMU. I tried to get in there, but they didn't want me. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
They're missing out. This school needs more robocoders. Though I did actually meet someone who had found robocode before, which was a first for me. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Question about waves: do you guys fire and/or update waves when the enemy is disabled? -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Umm, I just checked, and <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>' gun does... *blush* But no, you probably shouldn't. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
