<textarea name="text"  rows="20" cols="65" wrap="virtual" style="width:100%">Think you&#39;re pretty good at dodging bullets? How many can you dodge at once?

&#39;&#39;&#39;Directions&#39;&#39;&#39;

Here&#39;s how you run a MeleeSurfingChallenge:
* Get the reference bots here: https://davidalves.net/robocode/wiki.challenge.MeleeSurfingChallengeTeams_1.0.jar 
* Team A fires with HeadOnTargeting, Team B fires with LinearTargeting. Source code for both bots is included.
* Run 1000 rounds against each of them
* Arena size 1000 x 1000
* Everything else set to Robocode defaults
* You are not allowed to fire any bullets

Your bot&#39;s score is average amount of life you had at the end of each round. 100 means that the reference teams never hit you. You calculate your score like this: 
 100 - (reference team&#39;s bullet damage score / 1000)

Sparrow&#39;s Score is included for reference, it has a decent random melee movement.

For the &quot;Type&quot; column, show your melee and 1-v-1 movement like this: &lt;code&gt;RM/WS&lt;/code&gt; for RandomMovement in melee, WaveSurfing in 1-v-1.
&lt;pre&gt;
Key:
RM - RandomMovement
WS - WaveSurfing
SG - Stop &#39;n&#39; Go
MR - MinimumRiskMovement
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let&#39;s see some  high scores! 20 or more should be possible. =) --[[David Alves]]

I was on the way to build exactly this challenge bots, to test my team bots. Thanks for doing it :) But i think the reference bots should stop shooting, if they would hit a team mate. Or they must avoid friendly bullets. Otherwise a position in one line with two reference bots would give you an advantage. I´m not a melee specialist, but i think it´s not an advantage to do this in a normal melee match?! --[[Krabb]]

I&#39;m not a melee expert, but it seems like it might make sense to run this challenge on 1000x1000, since that&#39;s what the melee rumble runs in. Some MiniBots (and smaller) might have the size of the field hardcoded, I would think. Anyway, cool challenge, and nice scores [[Krabb]]. - [[Voidious]]

Ah sorry, field size was supposed to be 1000x1000, fixed now. Phoenix and Sparrow were run on 1000x1000.

I think there is to much free space in this challenge, its not realistic. May be we should raise the reference bots to 9 and let only 3 of them fire at the chellanger. But the actual chellange is still good to mesure the movement against HOT and LT, which is i think the goal of this challenge.--[[Krabb]]

I think without needing to avoid being targeted the test won&#39;t accurately reflect the robot&#39;s melee dodging ability. Although it would do terribly in a real battle, FemtoWalls sets a new high [[MeleeSurfingChallenge]] score (62.239 vs. team A). [[Krabb]]&#39;s idea might work to stop wall riders like this because the challenge bots will be getting disabled more evenly, making it much harder for robots that move a lot to win. Another (pretty drastic) solution would be making the challenge something like 6 challenge bots, the challenger, and 3 other movement-only bots with the sample bots shooting at the closest target.

&lt;pre&gt;
public class FemtoWalls extends Robot{ //this could implement droid too
	public void run(){
		turnLeft(getHeading() % 90);
		do{
			ahead(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);
			turnRight(90);
		}while(true);
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is not a challenge to mesure your meleeruble ranking! Its a good one to test your bullet avoidance against HOT and LT, and this is sure not the only factor in a melee battle. We must create more challenges to get an accurate reflection of the rumble and i think this is a good start. --[[Krabb]]

I see what you mean. Some challenges like the [[SpinBotChallenge]] are more of challenges in themselves rather than say the [[TargetingChallenge2K6]] which is kind of an extension of the rumble. I think it&#39;s good to see more melee-based challenges, as it is a very underlooked aspect of Robocode. -- [[Kev]]

This is not really meant as a good measure of bot performance, just a fun (and hard!) challenge, like SpinBotChallenge. =) --[[David Alves]]

[[Griezel]] survives 114 times against teamB and 0 (=zero!) times against teamA. I think [[Dummy]]&#39;s BlindDroid could score very well in this challenge.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

@Krabb: Why do you say &quot;score vs. Bot B broken?&quot; on your score comment? Was there some problem running the challenge? @Kev, you&#39;re right, we need more melee challenges... Let&#39;s revive the SampleBotMeleeChallenge. =) --[[David Alves]]

I first run the chellange on 800x600 and then tried it on 1000x1000. But while the 1000x1000 battle vs. Team A was running i worked on my gun and accidentally reduced the movement lateral velocity segmentation to one segment. May be &quot;broken&quot; is the wrong vocable :) --[[Krabb]]

Lol, I was just working on reference teams for exactly this! I didn&#39;t realize it was the same till just now. Do your bots avoid shooting each other?
