Man, you're good. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>

It's actually really funny that I first see this one of the few times I visit the wiki from my linux box :P -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
Would have been the same if I had visited it from my linux partition... -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>

Hey, I have some <a href="robowiki@Linux" class=wikipagelink>Linux</a> problems with <a href="robowiki@Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a>... -- <a href="robowiki@Frakir" class=wikipagelink>Frakir</a>

I have a big problem with RC on Windows XP. It only runs for so many rounds and then it just stops running. No crash or anything, just stops. I am using Java 1.4.1_02. Any clue whatsoever anyone? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Does it happens always or only sometimes? What happens to me (Win XP &amp; JRE 1.4.1) is that after running many matches in RC, it suddenly refuses to start my bot in the beginning of a match. The only way out is to close RC and re-open it (re-start: the MS solution...). It seems to happens only if i use the bot's debug window. No clues at all... -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>  
<p>
For me it takes an arbritrary number of rounds before it stops. Sometimes tousands of rounds, sometimes just a few. It doesn't matter if I run RC manually or if it is <a href="robowiki@RoboLeague" class=wikipagelink>RoboLeague</a> or <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home running it. This PC is a speed deamon and could deliver lots of RR@H battles if I could just solve this problem. I wish it crashed instead, then the RR@H client would restart and the problem would be much smaller. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I don't know of any reason that I can associate specifically with running it on windows, but I've seen similar behavior on specific computers more than others. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Does anyone know of an alternative to Sun's JRE on Windows? (That can maybe run RC) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
You could try IBM's: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/">https://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/</a> (I see you've already found blackdown for Linux...) --<a href="robowiki@FnH" class=wikipagelink>FnH</a>
<p>
That kind of behaviour makes me suspect of a dead-lock. That perhaps could explain why it happens (more) in the <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>'s super fast machine. Tell me <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>, it happens with any bot or just with one or few? Did u tried to test with simple bots battles (like Walls vs. <a href="robowiki@SittingDuck" class=wikipagelink>SittingDuck</a>)? The problem with a dead-lock is that is the most hard to find and correct kind of bug (worst if it happens in a non open source sw, like <a href="robowiki@Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a>). -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
Sorry, I have not noticed there's a question for me here. It happens with all bots. Sometimes it can run for pretty long (like 6000+ rounds). But most often I can't manage to get to collect enough battles to get the roborumble client to upload the results... The process of open sourcing Robocode has advanced a bit by the way. <a href="robowiki@Mat_Nelson" class=wikipagelink>Mat Nelson</a> has filled in and submitted the complicated paper work and there are people assigned to reviewing it. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
There is a work around that has been posted for the file saving issue that applies to at least JDK 1.4.2_02. Install and chage the batch scripts that start any Robocode instance by adding <code>"-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false" (ie: java -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -Xmx256M -jar robocode.jar)</code>. I have tested file savings with Roboleague, Robocode, and RR@H and they all seem to work (no Exceptions reported so far).
<p>
Interesting observation to add. Prior to upgrading, RR@H would always freeze after some indeterminate ammount of time. It rarely made it to double digit iterations and never once made it passed 12 iterations. Since installing RR@H has ran flawlessy. I am on iteration #40 and it is still running strong. If you are running Winodws XP I highly recommend this upgrade. -- <a href="robowiki@Sparafucil3" class=wikipagelink>jim</a>
<p>
Very interesting, do you meant that SecurityException<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=SecurityException" class=wikipageedit>?</a> issue that freezes bots that access disk, ain't? I'm going to test it, people interested in report tests in that bug, please report at <a href="robowiki@JRE_1.4.2_SecurityException_Bug" class=wikipagelink>JRE 1.4.2 SecurityException Bug</a> -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>

It seems my java freeze problem might have to do with my video card and its driver. I have a geforce card. I think the freeze has something to do with when the running java app does not have the focus... If someone recoginizes this problem, please help me with this. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
