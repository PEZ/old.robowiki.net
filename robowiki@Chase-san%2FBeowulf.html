<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

The gun is starting to rock.
<p>
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<p>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

Its in the top 100 somewhere, quiet surpising for how extremely messy its code is.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It uses a very funkafied version of surfing.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

It uses a Customly built <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> Gun, it has
<UL >
<li> 31 bins
<li> Bin Smoothing
<li> Rolling Averages
</UL>
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It uses a dual-wave surfing system I put into it in a very bad hack attempt at making it better.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

It doesn't really.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

It doesn't
<p>
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Saves Bin data between rounds, saves nothing between matchs.
<p>
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

From Beowulf Clusters of course.
Beowulf is a design for high-performance parallel computing clusters on inexpensive personal computer hardware.
<p>
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Sure, use and abuse, its really bad though. Parts of it come from other bots here and there, but its alot of bots, I will go through and recomment everything if beowulf ever makes it anywhere.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Not to much.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

A few, not sure which ones.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

<UL >
<li> Its basic structure is simular to basic surfer after tons of modification.
<li> It uses two versions of Chalk's getWallTries<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=WallTries" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, one for surfing and the other for targeting.
<li> It uses part of Komarious surfing system to keep from straying to close to the enemy.

<H4>Comments, questions, feedback:</H4>

I'm going to need help implimenting Segmentation in this thing as I have no idea on how to even begin. @_@ -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
I'd say to start by trying to segment on speed, or Math.abs(e.getVelocity()) in your on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a>. Store an <em>int speedIndex</em> on your waves, and make your GF array 2 dimensional. When you create the wave, set wave.speedIndex = Math.min(3, (Math.abs(e.getVelocity()) / 4)). (A compact way of saying 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8.) When you log the data, use that speedIndex as the first index into your array, and the GF bin as the second. When you aim, poll the speedIndex corresponding to their current speed. The idea is to have different GF data for similar situations. Make sense? -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Ahh, I understand, so I just juice up the array to make the guessfactor more exact, so its basically like adding guess factors for speed, distance, absolute angle, energy, and so on. But it would take a really long time to build up all those segments wouldn't it? -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Yes, basically your <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> is also a segment, though it is unique because it is the segment you are trying to predict. Yes, it takes time to build up accurate data, but firing a wave every tick, you can get some level of accuracy pretty quickly. Also, most enemies will spend 90% of their time in a small percentage of your segments. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I'm currently Fine Tuning my non-segmented gun. So this way there won't be alot more to work around when I go to start segmenting. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
I did the normal Targeting Challenge with two versions of Beowulf, each with thier own design of my gun. As you can see even after a little restructure it seems that the gun is still a little off. So I plan to make another version of the gun. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
I noticed my bot doesn't actually use rolling averages, and the way that it was set up actually killed the guns ability to aim by a good percent. I will see what I can do in the future to get RollingAverages<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RollingAverages" class=wikipageedit>?</a> rolling again. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Ookay, its been a little while since I posted, but I have been caught up in tweaking every last ounce of power from Beowulf's Gun. I revised the version numbers, I have done a total of 11 targeting challenges with this bot alone just to test each guns power. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
<p>
My dev7 branch is pretty good and I might run with it but it seems to be having problems with Cigaret. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Cigaret is a very good bot. It gives even a lot of the top bots a good fight, so don't sweat it too much if it's giving you problems. I still have problems with Iiley's bots. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
Okay, i'm going to run with the dev7 brach, i'm beginning work on movement now, i'll get back to the gun later. -- Chase-san
<p>
I threw togeather my gun mixed with some basic wave surfing (custom as the gun is) and it does horrible. In fact a pure copy/paste merger of <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> and <a href="robowiki@GFTargetingBot" class=wikipagelink>GFTargetingBot</a> does tons better. It looks like Beowulf needs some work before its ready for any high end applications. :P -- Chase-san
<p>
You are not the only one with that problem. My current version of <a href="robowiki@GresSuffurd" class=wikipagelink>GresSuffurd</a> is not much better than <a href="robowiki@BasicGFSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicGFSurfer</a>, while it has a segmented gun and a 'keep your distance' surfing. Especially the surfing is very sensitive for minor details, just try to focus on a simple surfmovement that can avoid <a href="robowiki@HeadOnTargeting" class=wikipagelink>HeadOnTargeting</a> first.  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
I updated Beowulf, maybe it might do a little better now? -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<UL >
<li>Only got a jump of 60 points, gonna try a new new version with all the bells, whistles and untested bleeding edge code I could fit into it. It now has alot fo stuff my most successful bots don't have, but this bot is basically held togeather with ducktape. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<li>Beowulf jumped another 122.34 points under my expert guidance, I like the way this ducktape bot is forming. :D
</UL>
<p>
Beowulf jumped another 44 or so points, none of my bots can seem to make it past the 1860 point barrier. Thus I need to put some work into a bot that will. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
And yet another <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfer" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfer</a> with GF-gun that outranks my non-surfing <a href="robowiki@FastTargeting" class=wikipagelink>FastTargeting</a> bot. Congratulations!  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
You still got <a href="robowiki@GresSuffurd" class=wikipagelink>GresSuffurd</a>, I so far don't have a chance to beat him. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Okay, my beowulf gained 3 points from using StrictMath<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StrictMath" class=wikipageedit>?</a> over the standard Math class. I did some research and found that StrictMath<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StrictMath" class=wikipageedit>?</a> is slower but more exact then Math. I did an experment using two indetical bots, except for one used StrictMath<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StrictMath" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and the other used math. I did 4, 1000 round tests just to make sure, the one using StrictMath<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StrictMath" class=wikipageedit>?</a> came out on top every time, and by a respectable margin aswell. However this was just for one bot, I have only tested it only minorly in other bots. However from my tests, I know that this modification's results aren't totally unfounded. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Are you sure that this isn't due to the advantage that bots get from being the first competitor added to a battle? Try this: take two identical robots and pit them against each other. The (1) robot will beat the (2) robot by a small margin. Are you sure that what you're finding isn't the same effect? 
<p>
--<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
No, not 100% sure actually, now that I think about, it I think it was mixed up, the Strict was in the second one or twice. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
