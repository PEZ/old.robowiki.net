<p>
100% success :-) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
Here's the roborumble.bat equivalent shell script for Unix/Linux<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RoboRumble/Linux" class=wikipageedit>?</a> systems:<pre>#!/bin/bash
cd robots
java -Xmx256M -cp .:../robocode.jar: roborumble.RoboRumbleAtHome ./roborumble/roborumble.txt</pre>I suggest you name it "roborumble.sh" and include it in the jar.
<p>
I didn't need to change anything else to get roborumble to run. But both aplha's have stopped responding on me after a couple of matches. Maybe it is done, maybe not. But it doesn't return and give me back my prompt.
<p>
While at it I have a few small suggestions. It would be cool to know how many matches and how many rounds and so it is intending to run before the matches begin. Also after each match Curious George inside me would like to know the results in that match. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
This is only the alpha version, i'm sure the interface will be improved later.  For now just look at the results file in the "files" folder.  It shows all the rules for the match (10 rounds, it seems), and the total scores, something that looks like it could be bullet damage and 1st survival. -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
The results file shows the following information:
<UL >
<li> First a header line with the "properties file" (I do that so we can have different competitions in the future, each specified by a different properties file, and the server recognizes them. Note, for example, that <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@home can now we used to run Team competitions - just use the team name instead of the bot name), the number of rounds, the field size, the user, and a time stamp (used as a unique identifier).
<li> Second line is the winner: bot name, score, bullet damage and survival (I skipped other fields to simplify).
<li> 3rd line is the looser.
</UL>
<p>
You can control the properties of the game by editing the roborumble.txt file (ie. you can change the user name, the number of rounds, etc.). f you want to execute more matches, just change the NUMBATTLES parameter.
<p>
The program will save the exected matches in the results file even if it crashes during execution. Unfortunately, it needs a big ammount of resources (pe. I can't run it in my old computer) but I don't know how to improve it. Suggestions are welcome. 
<p>
I agree it would be nice to build a shell on the top of the current application, to directly control the parameters file, choose which actions to perform, and show results, but for now it's enough work to have it running. -- <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>
<p>
I agree, for a 2nd alpha release this is fine.  The parameters should all be set by the server, but results and stuff would be good to have displayed later. -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Can we have roborumble clean up it's temp directory when it's done downloading and moved the bots to the correct directory? I don't like having each bot on my hd twice, even if they are small, when it's easily fixable. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
No problem, I'w add it to the next version. -- <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>
<p>
I think the interface is excellent, please keep it this way. I just would like a bit more verbose output while it's running. I like apps that tell me what they are about to do and some stats while it is doing it. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

The GUI addon got me worried about not being able to run Roborumble without a GUI environment. This seems to be the case even without that addon. Looking at the output from running aplha3 without a windowing environmeny present it seems like this is a problem with Robocode itself and maybe hard to avoid:<pre>Fighting... kawigi.sbf.FloodHT 0.8,kawigi.sbf.FloodMini 1.4

<p>
Isn't robocode supposed to be running in some invisible mode thing, so why is this happening? :-/ -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
It seems related to Robocode passing information to the window. Robocode runs hidden, but may be it passes some message as "Initializing battles" or something like that. Probably would be a good idea to separate completely the GUI. -- <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>
