I encountered this last night. No beer though :( But going out with my girlfriend tonight should cure me, right? --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
As long as you stay away from rc thoughts... My experience with this illness says that after a couple of days you will feel completely restored. :) -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> 
<p>
Having RC thoughts while with your couple should be disturbing :S ... :( I use to suffer stress cycles with anything i do, <a href="robowiki@Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a> is not different ... Good advice! -- <a href="robowiki@Qetu" class=wikipagelink>Qetu</a>
<p>
or you could go see Oklahoma! --<a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>

hmmm... that surrey with a turret and radar on top... I mean FRINGE!!!  FRINGE I SAID! -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
^lol! :-) --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Invite me on that laugh too please. What's a fringe? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Hair over the forehead.  What the Americans call "bangs". -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Thanks. And what's the bearing (sorry, couldn't resist) to Oklahoma? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Can't help you there, I'm afraid.  I'm also not sure about the use of the word "surrey".  I only know of it as a county in south England, and counties certainly don't have radars on top... -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>

You guys just aren't asking in the right place ;-) (it's the first definition on both pages).  Asking an English guy what the terminology means in an American musical... -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
I know that definition of fringe, and the shared root should be obvious, but I can't remember ever hearing of a "surrey".  And just because you Americans can't speak English properly, doesn't mean the someone from England isn't the best person to ask what an English word means. ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
And I'm still wondering about that joke. Stop giving me clues and tell me. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
a surry is a sort of horse draw carriage thing, i'm not really sure what the difference is. and fringe is what you get when you take a peice of cloth and cut it a lot, to make strips of cloth attached to each other that move around, sort of like a person's bangs. --<a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>
<p>
I think I am starting grasp the meaning of those two words. But where's Oklahoma in all this? This better be a good joke. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
well if you look up, all this oklahoma talk originated when i randomly said "or you could go see Oklahoma." the truth of the mater is, i went to see our school play, which happens to be Oklahoma this year, last night and randomly threw that up because i wasn't robocoding while watching the play. it's funny how somthing like that can turn into a really long discussion about the meanings of words. --<a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>
<p>
I have never heard of a play named Oklahoma. But now at least I know several meanings of the word fringe. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Yeah, and I thought it was about the place Oklahoma all this time. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
all the surrey and fringe stuff came from kawigi's comment, which is a joke about a song in the play -- <a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>Andrew</a>
<p>
This all is indeed the kind of discussion expected in a stress room :) -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>

Lyrics to "The Surrey With the Fringe on Top" from the musical Oklahoma: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/thesurre.htm">https://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/thesurre.htm</a> --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Lol, thanks.  And, Tango, I don't mean to say that asking an English person what an English word means is wrong, simply that asking an English person what the American usage of the word is might not be optimal ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Ayup, we've all got our own dialects, so stop hosin' on 'im, eh?  -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
I hate to steal your thunder <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>, but "Ayup" in an olde english expression used mainly in the midlands. That's assuming that you were using it as an example of your own dialect. You might not have been. God i'm bored... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
I realised you were refering to the play (musical?) a while back, which made it make a little more sense, but I have never seen it, so didn't know of the song.  I think the use of "ayup" was because it is well known as a dialect word.  I'll leave the anti-americanism for now, shall I? ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Yep, time for the anti-english-ism! (j/k) -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Argh! You're massacring the English language again! A hyphen before a suffix? Ouch! ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
How about a slash to seperate an abbreviation (i.e. - j/k)?  To quote some Strong Bad lyrics:
<blockquote>
And I don't care how they spell things on the Internet.
When you email me you spell the whole word out.
And I don't care if your cell phone has a camera in it...
</blockquote>
-- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Abbrev. (I love that) are different, (although there are rules).  They are used to get a point across without pressing many keys, rather than in a nice way.  A word split into 3 parts by hyphens looks ugly! (And I'm all in favour of spelling things out, save a few well known abbrev.) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
I think the Java language designers must have agreed that words split into 3 parts by hyphens was ugly.  Or even words divided into hyphens.  In some languages (like Lisp / Scheme maybe), set<a href="robowiki@TurnRadarRightRadians" class=wikipagelink>TurnRadarRightRadians</a> might have read set-turn-radar-right-radians instead. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Well Lisp is one of the most evil things in existance, the less said about it the better... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
Postscript is cool. There you cab have about any character in identifier names. I don't know about lisp, but people say PS share a lot with lisp. And PS is way fun to code with. For a geek that is. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
How are you (or more importantly, the compiler/interpreter) meant to know the difference between an identifier with hyphens in, and a subtraction sum? -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Lisp has a strange way of doing things - the operator always comes before the arguments. for instance 3 + 2 would be shown in lisp as (+ 3 2), everything is space seperated and has to be contained in brackets, so there is no way that a subtractive sum could be confused with a method name. It just seems really counter intuitive to me, hence why i passed my Scheme course last year by 1%. I now intend to avoid it for the rest of my natural life... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
I thought it was a Scheme course that had made you hostile to lisp. =) In Postscript things work similar to lisp. Though, as the name implies, everything is postfix. We have lisp which is prefixed, a-bunch-of-languages (Java is one) which are infix (if that's the word) and postscript which is postfix. Additionally in postscript there is no difference between an operator like "add" and your own function named "add" except that the first is built in and so primitive it is needed to build your own variant. Operators follow the same identifier rules as your own functions and variables. To express 3 + 2 in postscript you do "3 2 add". There's no way the hyphens, apostrophes, question-marks or whatever you use in your identifiers will ever be confused with math operators or some such. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

Help! I'm surrounded by grammar geeks! X-P --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

You'll never know -- I am currently attending a course in Standardized ML (the New Jersey implementation), so I too could start rambling on about this whole functional-languages-and-their-scary-bordering-on-evil-syntax thing. But I won't, because it gets <i>really</i> scary. -- <a href="robowiki@Scarpia" class=wikipagelink>Scarpia</a>

A little <a href="robowiki@Humor" class=wikipagelink>Humor</a> can help alleviate RSS :-) --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

I think I'm currently suffering from LackOfRobocodeSressSyndrome<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=LackOfRobocodeSressSyndrome" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. I'm really looking forward to spring break. Blah. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
If anyone wonders I have a Robocode break at the moment. It's been two weeks or so since I even looked at any of my bots. Of course, this widens my perspective on bots too so I get all sorts of ideas to try out when I start coding again. Within a week I would guess. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Sometimes we just need a break to refresh our thoughts... Good to know u soon will be back, I´m trying to wake up the people on the top (without success), any help shall be welcome. -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
I've been (slowly) restructuring my bot framework lately, this time using some OO principles, like inheritance and abstract classes. <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a> v3 is finally taking shape. :) -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<UL >
<li> I know that it is your bot, but I still think that Tron should be left as a milestone (One of the greatest bots of all-times). Afterall isn´t Shadow the natural evolution of Tron? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
</UL>
<p>
if anyone cares, i'm doing the same thing as PEZ. --<a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>]
<UL >
<li> Thanks, milestone for sure... -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>

Arggg... Here am i again in that stress, that time rc stress + work stress + personal stress = a huge amount of stress... Actually i think that <a href="robowiki@SilverSurfer" class=wikipagelink>SilverSurfer</a>´s <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> is completely broken... I´ll stay some days away from coding it (or any rc coding), till i get my mind in place.... -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>

I never encounter this syndrome, instead I encounter TooMuchRobocodeAddictSyndrome<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TooMuchRobocodeAddictSyndrome" class=wikipageedit>?</a> :-) I always robocoding (cannot take any break from it) while I have other (important) works to do. Shame on me. --<a href="robowiki@Nat" class=wikipagelink>Nat</a>
<p>
I was there for quite a while.  Late nights/early mornings while taking care of newborns made for some fuzzy days and fuzzier code.  I also made the mistake of installing robocode at work for a few weeks and got my wrist slapped :) --<a href="robowiki@Miked0801" class=wikipagelink>Miked0801</a>
