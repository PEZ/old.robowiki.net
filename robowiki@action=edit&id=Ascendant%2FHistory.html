* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 1.2.26&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 10 2006) - rating: 2089
** trying again the bullet detection of 1.2.24, after having found and fixed three minor issues, that might have affected the rating
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 1.2.25&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 30 2006) - rating: 2085

** experimental change in the algorithm that decides about going left or right, when surfing a wave

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 1.2.19b&#39;&#39;&#39; (April 30 2006) - rating: 2076
** bugfix in wall segmentation, the overlapping wall segments did not work as intended
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 1.2.19&#39;&#39;&#39; (April 25 2006) - rating: 2078

** changing again the method to determine when the curve flattener is to be activated (there are obviously guns in the rumble, that are able to hit Ascendant in non-flattening mode, but do hit even more when flattener is activated)
** disabling wall segmentation (will try that again, but maybe not vs all opponents)

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.9b&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 27 2004) - rating: 2051
** orbits again the origin of the nearest bullet, just to see how much this specific change influenced the rating of 0.9 (judging by my tests i expect a drop of at least 15 points)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.9&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 26 2004) - rating: 2063 (2058 in the new ranking)
** prefers now to move in a circle around the current position of the opponent instead of the bullets origin (may still switch to the latter to confuse advanced targeting methods)

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.7&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 21 2004) - rating: 2035
** removed the bot width awareness in movement (shouldnt have mixed up important bugfixes and changes in one release)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.6&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 20 2004) - rating: 2033

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.4&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 14 2004) - rating: 2037
** updating guess factor bins in targeting weighted by distance to the middle bin
** taking bot width into account when selecting the guess factor to fire at
** finally found and changed a piece of code that might have caused exceptions, this could explain the bad results for some pairings the versions 0.7.7 and 0.8.2 got
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.3&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 10 2004) - rating: 2032
** tampered with flattening once again and simplified some things there
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.2b&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 07 2004) - rating: 2029
** except for some minor refactoring a rerelease of 0.8.2
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.2&#39;&#39;&#39; (September 05 2004) - rating: recalled (invalid results)
** reworked the code that decides when to start flattening (includes removing a bug there) and a minor change in the way the flattening works
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.8.1&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 31 2004) - rating: 2032

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.7c&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 14 2004) - rating: 2027
** uses 47 guess factor bins again (just forgot to change this in 0.7.7b)
** fixed a small bug in targeting that was introduced after 0.7.1 (but no way that this was the reason for the strange results the other 0.7.7-versions got)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.7b&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 13 2004) - rating: recalled (still invalid results)
** rerelease of 0.7.7, since 0.7.7 got some invalid results i could not reproduce (i tested extensively)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.7&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 11 2004) - rating: 2016 (discarded due to some invalid results in the details sheet)
** almost the same as 0.7.1 (just to check whether 0.7.1 score was a fluke :-)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.6b&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 11 2004) - rating: 2004
** same as 0.7.6 but uses now 27 guess factor bins (as [[CassiusClay]] does)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.6&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 10 2004) - rating: 2004
** only updating a single guess factor bin per wave in targeting (according to a suggestion from [[PEZ]])
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.5&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 10 2004) - rating: 2021
** back to old guess factors (targeting)
** minor change in handling waves (targeting)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.4&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 08 2004) - rating: 2018
** rollback to 0.7.1
** increased maximum number of segments the gun uses
** account for bot width when calculating angles for guess factors 1 and -1
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.3&#39;&#39;&#39; (August 01 2004) - rating: 2023
** back to rolling average in the gun (as in 0.7.1) but using a more precise guess factor calculation
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7.2&#39;&#39;&#39; (July 30 2004) - rating: 2020
** same gun as before but using a simple visit count gun (int) instead of a rolling average

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.7&#39;&#39;&#39; (July 23 2004) - rating: 1999
** removed the virtual gun stuff
** uses now a guess factor gun with dynamic segmentation
** in the tests the new gun outperforms the old guns, it is weaker vs some stronger bots but hopefully makes up for this in the other battles

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.6.3&#39;&#39;&#39; (July 02 2004) - rating: 2001
** removed a minor targeting bug
** slower rolling average in the GuessFactor gun
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.6.2&#39;&#39;&#39; (June 26 2004) - rating: 1991
** removed LinearTargeting and PatternMatching guns
** tried to tweak the two remaining statistical guns to complement each other better
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.6.1&#39;&#39;&#39; (June 16 2004) - rating: 1978
** minor movement changes and a small refactoring (actually no change in score expected, this release is just to check whether all those changes followed by rollbacks introduced a bug somehow)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.6&#39;&#39;&#39; (June 10 2004) - rating: 1977
** tweaked the statistical guns: playing around with segmentation, firing waves every tick now
** quite thorough refactoring of the targeting system (might very well be broken somehow now, since the improvement of the guns did not really improve overall performance in the tests) 

* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.5.1&#39;&#39;&#39; (June 06 2004) - rating: 1959
** a lot of medium and minor movement changes that may or may not have made things better (at least the bot is certainly slower now :-)
* &#39;&#39;&#39;version 0.5&#39;&#39;&#39; (May 31 2004) - rating: 1938
** initial release
