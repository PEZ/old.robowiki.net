<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>I first saw Robocode when it was quite new (just a few months after it turned up in the IBM DeveloperWorks<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=DeveloperWorks" class=wikipageedit>?</a> site) but never tried to make a fighting bot.  
<p>
I'm mainly interested in bot movement code for a complex environment, with obstacles, mazes, etc. Robocode isn't a particularly good platform for that, but OTOH it's a very nice bot coding environment, so I've decided to construct my obstacles using passive bots and make an active bot (to be named Tourist :-) which maps and navigates around them.  
<p>
I may never try for a combat bot, but if Robocode NG gets off the ground, and has some complex battlefields, I might put a gun on Tourist and see how it works out. If nothing else, it will be good at hiding behind obstacles :-)

I'm the proud owner of a copy of Omega - the original bot fighting game product, from 1990 or thereabouts. Based on my experience with Omega I have a lot of ideas for what <a href="robowiki?RobocodeNG/Archive" class=wikipagelink>[RobocodeNG]</a> could become.  If anyone cares I can explain how Omega was designed, and what was good about it.  BTW - the bad things about Omega are all solved by Robocode - it had a terrible coding language and editor, allowed no more than 100 variables, no arrays/collections etc etc.  The bot features and the environment were really nice, but unfortunately it was impossible to code an interesting bot.
