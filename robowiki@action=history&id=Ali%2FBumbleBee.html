 There are still some fundamental differences, though. One of then is that, instead of a fixed MATCH_THRESHOLD, I use a fixed cluster size, so that when you don't have enough close <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.interseo.com">[matches]</a> you look for tendencies in not so close ones. Very much like using an unsegmented array when you don't have enough data for the segmented ones. -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a><br></td></tr></table><table width="95%" bgcolor=#cfffcf class=wikidiffnew><tr><td>

 You should really look into the fire time only prediction, it will increase your bot's speed like nothing else. I have a gun.class where I deal with that kind of stuff, and all my guns extend that class by overriding the getFireAngle<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=FireAngle" class=wikipageedit>?</a>(enemy) and other methods. You should maybe try making a HOT gun that does that, and tweak it until it fires at every chance it gets and always HOT, sitting duck is a good tester. I find your log cleaning very interesting, I just cap mine at 30000 scans, it only analyses data from the last 70 rounds or so, like a time-based data decay. Again, execution speed is crucial, you are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.activeshow.net">[struggling]</a> with 8000 samples, I use 30000 and still have time to do a lot of PM stuff on it... -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a><br></td></tr></table><table width="95%" bgcolor=#cfffcf class=wikidiffnew><tr><td>

 Ali is still a bit faster than Shadow, some 135% faster I think.

 OK so I've now got the matching to run only once per bullet fired. And I also changed to a Manhattan distance calculation which, strangely enough, seems to work better but is also faster. Now the log is allowed to grow above 30000 waves and Ali is still more than twice as fast as Shadow I think. As it should be since my gun use simple GF techniques instead of projecting movement to find out where to fire. I've tweaked the weighting of some of the dimensions now and the gun performs better in my tests.
