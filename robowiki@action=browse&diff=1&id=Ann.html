Welcome to Robocode (and the Wiki).  Kick <a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>his</a> fanny. -- <a href="robowiki?Martin_Alan_Pedersen" class=wikipagelink>Martin</a> <font size=-4>(My first thought was that this was a post about artificial neural networks.)</font>

Hey, welcome to the wiki! Good luck with your first bot. --<a href="robowiki?Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>He</a> won't stand a chance against what i'm building! But of course its not all self made code. I'm basing parts off some of the wiki bots. Like <a href="robowiki?BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> and so on. -- Ann
<p>
Welcome to the Wiki, Ann. I think you might be our first female wiki citizen. =) I'd suggest starting with something a little simpler than <a href="robowiki?BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a>, that's pretty tough stuff to tackle before you've had much time to get familiar with Robocode. Starting out by writing a <a href="robowiki?LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> gun, then moving to a <a href="robowiki?GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> gun might be a better way to get warmed up. Be sure to let us know if you want help with anything. Voidious and I are often on on AIM, but the best place place to ask for help is probably on the wiki... unless you want to keep it a secret from your brother. ;-) Good luck! --<a href="robowiki?David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

I'm the only girl? I feel so like a nerd now. Oh well, anyway, considering I have to kidnap his computer to do it (mine is to old to run anything quickly), i'm pretty sure he will know what i'm doing. I'll look into linear guns (which so happens I found a class called project in <a href="robowiki?BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a>, which will help with that). -Ann

Hi, Ann. Welcome to the wiki! I'd suggest making <a href="robowiki?NanoBots" class=wikipagelink>NanoBots</a>. Although that may seem too restrictive and tough at a glance, that helps learning robocode mechanics and clear meanings. -- <a href="robowiki?Stelokim" class=wikipagelink>Stelokim</a>
<UL >
<li>While I'd agree that starting less ambitious is good, I think coding with code size in mind does not make things clear.  The <a href="robowiki?Strategy" class=wikipagelink>Strategy</a> page is probably one of the better places to start to gain familiarity with all that is Robocode. -- Martin

Welcome to this 'nerdy' wiki. <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a> has made an excellent <a href="robowiki?ExtendsRobot" class=wikipagelink>ExtendsRobot</a> called <a href="robowiki?Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a>, but I don't think that that counts. It seems a good idea to start with something easy like <a href="robowiki?RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> and <a href="robowiki?LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a>, just to understand the basics and the behaviour of Robocode. You will probably pick up things a lot faster than I did, so in a few weeks I'll expect at least a top-100 bot from you!  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Welcome from me too! <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> is surely not the easiest way to get started, but if you're up for some serious <a href="robowiki?WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a>, knock yourself out :P I second Martin's comment that making <a href="robowiki?CodeSize" class=wikipagelink>CodeSize</a> restricted bots might be a bad idea, but I would recommend using them as opponents to test against when you start, because they are limited in features while still often good overall bots. And don't worry, you don't have to be a girl to feel nerdy for programming tanks in your spare time... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
You bet I will, i'll be in the top 100 in no time! Nothing's gonna stop me. I already got a linear gun working. Chase wants me off his computer now, since i'v been on it all day. ^-^ --Ann
<p>
The guess factor gun was harder then I thought it would be, but i'll try to get it working. --Ann
<UL >
<li>The thing with guess-factor guns (and really any advanced gun) is that they are never really done.  Even after you get it relatively bug free, there's all sorts of tuning you can do. -- Martin
</UL>
<p>
My guessfactor didn't work out, so instead i'm trying to get a pattern matcher working. --Ann

Help! It doesn't work, what went wrong?

I just don't know what its doing wrong, it should aim and fire where the bot should be next. -- Ann
<p>
Do some graphical debugging - draw where your robot thinks the enemy is and where they should be. At least, assuming it's merely inaccurate, rather then actually crashing. I wrote a simple pattern matching gun recently, and that had the problem that I had the sign one of the factors the wrong way around - so I was working out the right pattern, it was just the wrong way around. You might have a bug like that.
<p>
Your Java code is much better then mine, though. It's Greek to me. --<a href="robowiki?Jp" class=wikipagelink>Jp</a>

I have no idea how to do visual debugging. I decided to scrap the code, it was making robocode run really slow. I'll try making one with normal arrays and reweight the heading which has a weight of about 6 (0 to 2pi) and the velocity which has a weight of about 14 (-8 to 8). Perhaps set the velocity to absolute. --Ann
<p>
Any pattern matcher is going to run really slowly.  It's the nature of the beast.  It may be a fun exercise (which is really what Robocode boils down to in the end) but be prepared for really slow performance while testing and in the Rumble.  If you want some graphical debugging code, I posted some a while ago <a href="robowiki?Ugluk/RobocodeSG" class=wikipagelink>here</a> and David Alves has posted some <a href="robowiki?David_Alves/DrawingBot" class=wikipagelink>here</a>. -- Martin
