<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>An idea I had for reliably destroying <a href="robowiki?LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>....I'll get it working properly when I have time ;-) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
This could get interesting. =) I've also been pondering this, and planning to look into some "kill the non-Droid first" strategies, as well as tweaking anti-ram. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I have thought of a few ways that could be used to beat <a href="robowiki?LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>, however, most are tactics that would perform poorly against the traditional <a href="robowiki?TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> contenders and would not be easy to auto-detect when to use. I don't think it would be difficult to build a bot that will trash <a href="robowiki?LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> reliably, however both beating it and beating other contenders may could be difficult due to the codesize limits. I look forward to see what people come up with! Just be warned I do have ideas of how to counter some tactics against <a href="robowiki?LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>. :) -- <a href="robowiki?Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, the idea I have would be pretty hard to get around...it would involve targeting the non-droid specifically, like <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a> said. Even if you barely have any energy left, if the only bot left is a droid it will be easy pickings... On the other hand I could just come up with my own implementation of a surrounding rambot style, with both bots being non-droids =) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, from my observations of battles,  targeting the non-droid first won't do that much good I think. Feel free to try it though. :) I am considering making the droid not a droid any more anyways some time, though that would only be worth it if either 1) I can make sufficient gains from keeping tabs on the other opponent,  or 2) People start to be able to kill the leader first reliably. I'm personally more confident in the former than the latter, but I guess I'll see how things go. To do that though I'll have to find ways to shrink a pretty large chunk of codesize... I find it interesting that both of you seem to classify <a href="robowiki?LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> as a rambot, however I wouldn't call it one at all because it's not like it will ram a sitting duck except by fluke accident, it just moves where the opponent would be prone to inadvertently ram my team :) -- <a href="robowiki?Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
What makes you say this? If we ONLY target the non-droid, it will be killed first, no questions asked, especially if we choose to fight a battle with bot our bots quite close in. Even if you manage to kill my leader first, my other bot will be able to go for your leader as well, and even if I kill it then, it will still be easy to destroy the droid. I think having both your bots starting with 200 energy will confuse some bots though, which is why I figured out another way to detect the non-leader ;-) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

<li> Both bots starting with 200 energy? The leader gets an extra 100 and the Droid gets an extra 20, so you can always detect leader / non-leader and droid / non-droid. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<li> Ah thanks, I've never worked with Droids. I thought Droids also got a 100 energy boost. But I think for a 20 energy boost it isn't really worth it having a droid instead of a full <a href="robowiki?TeamRobot" class=wikipagelink>TeamRobot</a>. -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

Well what I have found from observing battles, is when current opponents both happen to target my leader it certainly hasn't done them much good very often, of course this may change if your strategy is more than simply being like current opponents but targeting the leader first.  Either way though, some defensive strategies I'm considering (which involve keeping tabs on both enemies) may help be able to counter that to some degree. Also, I was about to note what Voidious said above until he caused me an edit conflict :-P -- <a href="robowiki?Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
