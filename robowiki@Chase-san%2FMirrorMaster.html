<a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>
<p>
<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

Its Bubblegum Pink!
<p>
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

You can get it at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.MirrorMaster_0.0.3.jar">http://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.MirrorMaster_0.0.3.jar</a>
<p>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

We'll find out now won't we.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It uses Mirror movement and wall smoothing (which abiet needs work).
I made the bot to dodge around nearby enemies, e.g. rambots and to avoid mirror collisions.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

It uses a stylized version of my old GF gun.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It uses the enemies own movement against it, in more then one way, you should see it dodge around <a href="robowiki@RamBot" class=wikipagelink>RamBot</a>.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

It doesn't really.
<p>
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

It doesn't
<p>
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Saves Bin data between rounds, saves nothing between matchs.
<p>
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

For the way it moves, it used to a few different mirroring techniques and combines them with rambot dodging and wallsmoothing.
E.g. Its a master of mirror movement (supposively).
<p>
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Sure if you want, Its in the jar under the <a href="robowiki@RWPCL" class=wikipagelink>RWPCL</a>. Try and fix the wall smoothing for me if you can.
<p>
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Try and add in a decent Melee mode, try and figure out the best one to copy via way of checking which had the most energy when my bot died or when my bot wins. It will probably vary between rounds (which will throw off all those GF guns for sure).
<p>
Perhaps change MirrorModes<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MirrorModes" class=wikipageedit>?</a> between rounds, instead of constantly during the round(which actually made 0.0.1 easier to hit).
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Umm, i'm not sure it does pretty well vs anything below it in the rumble.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

I uses a highly modified GoTo<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=GoTo" class=wikipageedit>?</a> snippet.

The wall smoothing is kinda borked, any suggestions? -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
No suggestions at present, but I am willing to bet that <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a> will steal its lunch money.  I used to use a mirroring movement when faced with rambots (combined with wall anti-grav) but the better rambots cornered and crushed me.  -- Martin
<p>
It looks like this bot is crashing on one or more RR clients. It's getting unusually low scores against everyone it has fought. --wcsv
<p>
Thats odd, it works flawlessly on my version of robocode. Any idea why? -- Chase-san
<p>
Ok, I just tried to run it in Robocode 1.0.6 and it crashed b/c the setAllColors<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=AllColors" class=wikipageedit>?</a> method doesn't exist in that version. All clients should be using 1.1.3 (which has that method), but it looks like one isn't. My suggestion would be to re-release it just using the setColors(c1, c2, c3) method until we get this resolved. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a> 
<p>
Ahh yah, okay reuploaded, the new version 'should' work now, i'll forgo the updating the participates page, as the score will even out with enough battles. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Yes, you should update the participants page. If you don't clients that already have downloaded it won't get the new one. They'll just keep using the old one. -wcsv
<p>
Well, as I for one am running 1.0.7 for all versions of Roborumble.  That's one at work overnight, and 3 cpu's at home.  I have only really been running the one at work lately, and it is running tonight.  I guess that's one drawback to changing the API.  Wouldn't the bot get a score of 0 though, and not have its score updated?  -- Martin
<UL >
<li>I have confirmed that my processing of <a href="robowiki@MirrorMaster" class=wikipagelink>MirrorMaster</a> at work was just getting a score of 0, so it wasn't affecting the Rumble.  I will update to 1.1.3.  This may seem odd coming from me since I have little interest in a small code size bot, but it seems to me that providing the new API function gives an advantage to newer bots.  It's not a major advantage, but .. well .. something for the philosophers I guess. -- Martin
</UL>
<p>
Yeah, I don't know where those scores are coming from, but it seems to be doing much better now with that fixed. Also, I think it was getting zero against a lot of bots, 'cuz it was sitting there for hours with only 5 battles. I'll try to run my client when I go to bed, but for now I need my processor for actual work... -<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a> 
<p>
<a href="robowiki@MirrorMaster" class=wikipagelink>MirrorMaster</a> performs quite acceptable, but don't mirror a spinbot equiped with a CT-gun (<a href="robowiki@GrubbmOne" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmOne</a>) ;-) Mirroring a lousy movement gives yourself a lousy movement too.  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
True, but remember that its "<a href="robowiki@MirrorMaster" class=wikipagelink>MirrorMaster</a>", e.g. it mirrors the enemy to a large degree. I still need to fix the wall smoothing (now that I know how to fix it) so a variation in the smoothing may produce a bit of difference. I plan to drop in a copy of my new gun into it once said gun is done (it uses virtual bullets, GF and such). Part of my Gigabot(like a Megabot but alot huger :P) Tyrra. -- Chase-san
