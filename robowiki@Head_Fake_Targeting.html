<p>
<i>My recommendation is for this targeting method to be part of a set of targeting options, used only if it is shown to be the most likely to hit a particular opponent.</i>
<p>
<p><b>Quick and Dirty</b> - fast way to code it</p>
<p>
<p>Take any targeting method you already have (other than dead-on) and find the predicted difference in angle from dead-on.  Shoot at the opposite angle (compared to dead-on).  (e.g. your opponent is at 15 degrees, your circular targeting says to fire at +20 degrees, you fire at 355 degrees.)</p>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p><b>Realistic</b> - proper way to code it</p>
<p>
<p>Create a new targeting method based on any targeting method you already have (other than dead-on).  Assume your opponent will accelerate at top speed in the opposite direction.  Extrapolate his position until you have an acceptable firing solution.</p> 
<p>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p>This targeting method is intended against opponents to try to head-fake you by heading one way to feed your target prediction a bad assumption, then reversing direction once they detect that you have taken a shot.</p>

Before I tried <a href="robowiki?PatternMatching" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatching</a> and then <a href="robowiki?GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>, I had one type of "compound aimer" that would apply a multiplier to another aimer. Feeding it a factor of -1 (and, say, a circular aimer) would have done exactly what you're describing here (well, the Q&amp;D way). I also think that multiplying an offset by a fraction  (like .5 instead of -1) could be effective versus certain types of movements. Just my two cents on a way to further abstract this concept.
<p>
In the end, <a href="robowiki?PatternMatching" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatching</a> or <a href="robowiki?GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> guns should handle this situation appropriately on their own (with proper segmentation). GF is what I'm pursuing right now. If your implementation of <a href="robowiki?VirtualGuns" class=wikipagelink>VirtualGuns</a> were less bug-ridden than mine was (as I later realized), this might work really well. :) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

While I expect guess-factor targeting (which to me is a misnomer because I will not be guessing anything more than regular targeting) to be able to nail the same targets, I view this to be an extension to simpler targeting methods, whereas guess-factor targeting is really a lot more involved and not something a novice bot programmer will undertake (unless he is not right in the head). --<a href="robowiki?Martin_Alan_Pedersen" class=wikipagelink>Martin Alan Pedersen</a>
