<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Hi all, I'm Luke.
<p>
At the moment of writing this, I'm only just back into robocode after a full year away from it (I just didn't have the time!).  
<p>
I'm glad to see my bot, labg.Cataclysm, has still been battling away in my absence.  I'm currently working on the next generation of Cataclysm which I have set the modest goal of reaching a top 50 position in the RR@H melee competition.  At this point, he's probably at  least 2 weeks away from completion.
<p>
Anyhow, I'm just glad I can be a part of this fantastic and talented community!
<p>
Catchya later...

Cool to see some one focus on melee, Welcome back Luck:}  -- <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>

Thanks iiley.  There does seem to be a larger focus on 1v1 battles compared to melee, you're right.  I suppose 1v1 is the most pure form of competition in robocode, there aren't as many unknowns in 1v1 which I suppose makes it more of a pure 'battle of wits' 
compared to melee which inherently involves more guesswork and compromise.  That's probably why melee appeals to me more, simply because I know I don't stand a chance against many of the advanced 1v1 bots!  That being said, I do hope to make my next bot at least vaguely competitive in 1v1, we'll see how I go! --<a href="robowiki?Luke" class=wikipagelink>luke</a>

Welcome back to Robocode land. I have been focusing on 1v1 since day 30 or so in my robocoding. But for me it is the need to <strong>focus</strong> rather than anything else. Melee is just as pure I would think. Just more complicated. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
