<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext><H3>The Irish National Robocode Competition</H3>

This competition is mentioned elsewhere on the wiki. But now there's a reason to dedicate at least one page for it. I don't know the details of this competition. Read about it on its own site: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robocode.ie/">http://www.robocode.ie/</a>
<p>
One of the organizers of the competition, Philip Bourke, has asked me to see if there is/are someone(s) in the wiki community who are willing to produce a "pit tank" for the comming 2005 competion. This should be a <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>Melee</a> capable bot that the students can pit their tanks against. I didn't fully understand if this pit tank would be allowed to extend <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>. But anyone feelingup for the task contact Phil directly: tippinst.ie (pbourke@). -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
That sounds like fun, and of course someone from the wiki here should help them out with this! Did anyone contact them yet? If so add a page on the wiki for the bot when development has started! If noone has replied yet I might consider this. I'm also interested in knowing how much time and resources a competition like that requires, and how difficult it would be to get sponsors. Sweden should have one! After all we have 3 out of 4 top spots in the 1vs1 (general, mini, nano) and the fourth (micro) is a 2nd position. Well at least before the crash. :-) --<a href="robowiki@Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>

I wrote him and offered to write a bot, haven't heard back. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

I believe this tournament doesn't allow <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>s.  They also have an interesting rule that all source must be in a single file (although it can be multiple classes still).  Maybe I'll enter and mock them by having a massive <a href="robowiki@TheArtOfWar" class=wikipagelink>TheArtOfWar</a> amount of code in that one file.  And, as it's an <a href="robowiki@ExtendsRobot" class=wikipagelink>ExtendsRobot</a> competition, I'd win it at this point ;-)  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that it's available to everyone. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>

But pit tanks could possibly be allowed to be AdvancedRobots<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=AdvancedRobots" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, who knows.
-- <a href="robowiki@Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
<p>
No, it's not available to everyone. But they have asked for a "pit tank" which would not be taking part in the competition. More like a one of those "hares" they use in long distance running sometimes. Please help them with it if you can. And they are considering an <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a> division too. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
