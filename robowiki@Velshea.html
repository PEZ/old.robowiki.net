<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

Its my first 100% custom robot, no to Very little c and p
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<UL >
<li>Version 1.1.0: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.Velshea_1.2.0.jar">https://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.Velshea_1.2.0.jar</a>
</UL>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

I would like to think its better then Tyrra now, dispite still losing to it.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It Wavesurfs, using my own special blend.
<p>
<H4>How does it Aim?</H4>

It uses a rather advanced guessfactor gun.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It uses wavesurfing most the time, sometimes it just stops (donno why) which throws off some good advanced targeting.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

Erm, hmm good question.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

I guess it would surf the last wave it detected.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

It saves data between rounds.
It did save surfing databetween rounds, but I turned that off for now.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

Same place I got the colors for it, from my system background at the time of its making. Interesting how that turns out huh.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Sure, its in the jar, released under the <a href="robowiki@RWPCL" class=wikipagelink>RWPCL</a>.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

<UL >
<li> Fix the annoying seizures it has sometimes (movement stops)
<li> Segment the movement better.
<li> Fix up the gun more, as it currently is worse then my original Velshea prototype. Perhaps add in a Virtual Bullet array, witha anti-surfer gun.
</UL>
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Ha, may the <a href="robowiki@SandboxLump" class=wikipagelink>Lump</a> fear it well!
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

I got a few ideas from many bots. But I do have have the nearHalfPI<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=HalfPI" class=wikipageedit>?</a> function from Komarious in her. It was a little more effective then my own.

Funny thing too, Velshea's last ranking of about 200 to 300 or so was because of a single bug. She is my first "girl" bot in a manner of naming, I hope she can hold a ranking of atleast 1800 with my most recent modification. -- Chase-san
<p>
Is me or do my bots like holding positions that are multiples of 25? Tyrra is about 50(it moves between 50 and 51), Velshea is holding around 75th and Beowulf is at 225. I guess I need to make Beowulf good enough to take the 100th place. The hard part is getting one for 25th. -- Chase-san
<p>
Rank 0 would be hard too :P --<a href="robowiki@Krabb" class=wikipagelink>Krabb</a>

I am working on a new version now, version 1.0.0, This version will be bot a melee and 1on1. I won't say anymore until I actually get to work on it. Though this may take awhile as i'm experiencing <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Can anyone else figure out why this gun is so slow? I have rebuilt it a few times now and I can't figure out why its so very slow. You can find it at: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.v1.VelGun_1.0.jar">https://jad.tfsnewworld.com/bots/chase.v1.VelGun_1.0.jar</a> Its currently just a normal unsegmented gf gun, but its massively slow, and I have no clue why. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
You aren't removing waves when they hit, so by the end of the round you have 500 waves or more in the air, each of which is registering a hit every turn. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

<li>I had never used custom events until I redesigned my event handling, and I needed something to trigger the processing of all events in the queue.  I register it at the start of the first turn and never unregister it.  Since the bot is spawned anew with each round, I never have more than one. -- Martin
</UL>
<p>
OH Whoa, no wonder its slow, i'm glad custom events don't transfer between rounds. Thanks! Its always the small things. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
