Adaptive movement: using the enemy's hit rate as input to change your own movement in some way.

<li> A way of doing it is choosing from a set of possible movements by measuring the relative success of each one of them in dodging enemy fire. <a href="robowiki@PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> and <a href="robowiki@Swiffer" class=wikipagelink>Swiffer</a> are good examples of this kind of <a href="robowiki@AdaptiveMovement" class=wikipagelink>AdaptiveMovement</a>.

It is necessary to do the two last tings in the list. At a minimum you need to know when you are hit at GF1 so you can try balance it, like <a href="robowiki@Paolo" class=wikipagelink>Paolo</a> does.

What I am currently implementing is a system of 5 to ten <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> methods.

You know, there's something to just trying things that have been tried and failed at - I wonder if time segmentation would have been simply given up on after Jamougha said he tried it with no success if I didn't chime in and say I'd also experimented with it and only been successful with a smaller number of segments.
<p>
About switching movements, have either of you added in a <a href="robowiki@CoolMovement" class=wikipagelink>CoolMovement</a>-based one?  That should have a very unique flaw as far as complimentary peaks.  It still may not be helpful against the good GF guns, but who knows? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>

I suspect people would have kept trying to segment on time, it's something that, to me at least, seems a very logical possibility for segmenting.

I agree, Kawigi. That idea in particular because I think I could have made it work if I wasn't attracted to working on nanos. :p And I tried this long before <a href="robowiki@CoolMovement" class=wikipagelink>CoolMovement</a>, so the answer for me is no.
<p>
On the subject of segments: One other thing I've never made a bot big enough for, but this I have had successes with, is dividing the battlefield up into 9 boxes and segmenting based on which box the opponent is in. The corner boxes were especially handy, and the only walls segment you need to go with it is a '0 if not approaching, 1 if approaching' type segment. It also messes with <a href="robowiki@AdaptiveMovement" class=wikipagelink>AdaptiveMovement</a> by arbitrarily switching between valid peaks ;) Unfortunately for pure anti-adaptation purposes I never had too much luck in my attempt to convert it to a segment that just counts 0 1 2 0 1 2 ... incrementing one in the sequence on every bullet fire (maybe I should've only counted bullet hits).
<p>
@Alcatraz: It all depends on how you dodge. <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> is just a form of straight bullet dodging (dodge where they went last time), but latching onto a pattern in it isn't terribly helpful, since it is Borg-like an adapts. Tracking gun cool is just another handy element in making your dodging decisions, what you do with it can vary quite a bit.

<a href="robowiki@CoolMovement" class=wikipagelink>CoolMovement</a> isn't really <em>just</em> bullet dodging - it's changing directions when the opponent is firing after having just barely changed directions earlier (when the enemy's gun is "cooling").
