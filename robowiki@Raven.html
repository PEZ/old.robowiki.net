<b>Version 0.2 (Coming real soon)</b>  New tweaked Pattern Matcher (boosted the PMC index over 100%),  Huge movement improvement (not really taht difficult as it was awful before) Wall avoiding oscillation, looks kinda like the lovechild of DT and cigaret (to me at least). Now saves data between rounds. 
<b>Version 0.1</b>  Pattern Matcher, with a wall avoidance oscillation. No distancing control, no data saving. 
<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

Well i actually released this one rather than having "one last tweak" and then mashing the code till i start over.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

Getting better - now at least makes a few of the top bots break into a sweat occasionally
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

To be perfectly honest, i'm not that sure any more... Any logic that was involved when i started has been replaced by anything that seems to work better. 
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

Has a variable length symbolic pattern matcher (100.04% PMC at the last check). Maximum search length 128 scans, 5000 scan history.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

Although teh firing of a bullet is recorded it is not directly dodged (i don't think...)
<p>
<H4>What does it save between matches?</H4>

The scan history, in a very similar way to how Pez did in <a href="robowiki@LeachPMC" class=wikipagelink>LeachPMC</a> (i had problems doing it any other way).
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

Well until recently it was a half finished bot that i started ages ago. I can't remember how it got the name
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

No, would be the short answer. At some point i'll pretty it up and release it. All the ideas in my bots are based on ideas found elsewhere, unfortunately there is nothing innovative to use...
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Well, i still remain unconvinced by my <a href="robowiki@PatternMatcher" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatcher</a> but the stat guns are progressing in quite the way i'd hoped
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Far too many to mention, but particularly Fermat, and anything with the name duelist...
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

Idea's inspiration from loads of people. I've pretty much tried to absolve all of the information from this wiki and stick it into one bot (Cheers PEZ!!). Pez, Kawigi, Rozu and Albert have probably been the most influential...
<p>
<H4>Comments, questions, feedback:</H4>

Ok, i'm desperate for comments on my movement and gun. Give him a go, then tell me what you think... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
