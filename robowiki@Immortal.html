<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

1.31 has a modified surfing mechanism and higher weighting for visit stats.
<p>
1.3 tries to surf visit stats and not hit stats (Made it to 2000).
<p>
1.2 is doing some weird wave surfing.
<p>
1.13 tweaked a few movement things and makes sure that the Freddie Movement / HeadOnTargetting<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=HeadOnTargetting" class=wikipageedit>?</a> Avoidance is working properly.
<p>
1.12 uses Freddie's movement to beat up on some bots that were giving 1.11 trouble.
<p>
1.09, like the previous versions, wants to spend its time at the wall the enemy is farthest from. It changes directions based on an array. The array keeps track of how often it has moved in one direction for a certain amount of time and avoids the most common moves. 
<p>
0.99 now avoids head-on aim, not the <a href="robowiki?MusashiTrick" class=wikipagelink>MusashiTrick</a> though.
<p>
0.88 generally stays close to the walls, moving to the one farthest away from the opponent. I don't know why this works, but it does, so now I'm afraid to change it.
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

1.3 is using a slightly modified version of the updated Cyanide gun which is essentially the Bee gun
<p>
1.2 switched over to Cyanide's gun
<p>
1.13 has a new guess factor gun, segmenting on lat velocity, adv velocity, acceleration, distance, walls, and time since last deceleration.
<p>
0.98 uses a guess factor gun. It actually has three, "A", "B", and "C". A is the least segmented and it uses this until it has enough data to use B and then enough to use C, which segments on lateral velocity, advancing velocity, acceleration, time since last direction change, whether bot is near the wall, right at it, or in a corner, and distance.
<p>
0.88 uses a nano pattern matcher.
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

Mostly randomly.
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

There is no melee strategy.
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

Whoever it sees first.
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

1.12 saved stuff between matches, no other version did. Between rounds, almost everything is saved.
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

A song called "Immortal" by the band Adema.
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

No, and I'm willing to lose those karma points. For now.
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Wave surfing. I've been trying for a long time to get that working, but it hasn't, so I finally figured just to do this latest small version and not go for a bigger jump.
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Yep, quite a few.
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

An earlier Immortal and all the guess factor stuff here.

<p>
how are the three different guns working out for you?--<a href="robowiki?Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>
<p>
Good, I guess. It's really just three different segmentation types, so theoretically it should allow me to learn both quickly and eventually to learn well. --<a href="robowiki?Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
i think i'm just going to use linear aim before the first couple waves get in. sound reasonable?--<a href="robowiki?Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>
