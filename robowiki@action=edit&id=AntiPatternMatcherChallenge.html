A part of the MovementChallenge. This is the setup:
* PatternMatcherBot (currently a stationary [[Ender]], available at http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1568)
* The Challenger (your bot)
* Arena size 800 x 600
* 500 rounds
* Everything else set to Robocode defaults
Additionally:
# Challenger is not allowed to fire any bullets at all
# The ratio &quot;Challenger score / PatternMatcherBot score&quot; * 100 is the Challengers [[/APMCIndex]]
==== Also see ====
[[/APMCIndex]] - [[/ChallengerChat]]

Since the current PatternMatcherBot is slow I suggest running only 100 rounds. This or use some other good PatternMatching gun that runs faster. -- [[PEZ]]
* i disagree. There is too much variance in results with 100 rounds. I personally don&#39;t find PMBot disturbingly slow but that depends on the way you work i guess. Again, i wouldn&#39;t mind if another gun is put in PMBot if that is what everyone wants --[[Vic]]
* Consider 200? -- [[Kawigi]]

500 should not be a problem. this doesn&#39;t mean that you have to test your bots always with 500 rounds. btw I think it isn&#39;t meant to run 100 500-round-battles and then post his/her best result... (I might have years to do this) :) -- [[rozu]]

OK. But I&#39;m the impatient type. It takes more than 3 hours for me to run 500 rounds as it is. But it&#39;s doable anyways and [[Vic]] might find ways to improve the speed. -- [[PEZ]]

wow 3 hours, I just wanted to write the time I need (15 minutes) because I thought no one can top this, in this case wee should reduce it to at least 200 as Kawigi proposed -- [[rozu]]

15 minutes! I must buy a new computer. However I think that the two challenges should be run with about the same conditions and since [[Paul Evans]] wants 1000 rounds in the CurveFlatteningChallenge I would suggest 500 in both as a compromise. (DT is also a slow bot). -- [[PEZ]]

But DT isn&#39;t as slow as many.  I would rather do 1000 rounds against DT 1.91 in index mode than 500 against PatternMatcherBot :-p -- [[Kawigi]]

&#39;oh ye of little patience!&#39; .. I&#39;ll do something about the performance of PatternMatcherBot -- [[Vic]]

[[PEZ]], i&#39;ve sent you a new version of PMBot that has a much better performance. Also it incorporates your suggestions on 1.3 compatibility. If you&#39;re ok with it i&#39;ll make it a public release 1.3 -- [[Vic]]

I find it rather impossible to find Ender to download to do this test.  Are there any other PMBots that are downloadable that would be accurate for this? -- [[Goofy]]

I think that FunkyChicken would be a good choice, think that is a very &quot;strait&quot; PM (right [[Kawigi]]?). But probably someone else can upload it and post a link here (For the challenge purpose it would be better Ender)... -- [[Axe]]

We could try LeachPMC I guess. It will certainly not move around. =) -- [[PEZ]]

It seems that the search functions on the RobocodeRepository are broken. Nevertheless PatternMatcherBot is still available there: http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1568 --[[Vic]]
