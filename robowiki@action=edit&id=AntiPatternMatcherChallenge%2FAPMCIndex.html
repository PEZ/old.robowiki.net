Bots above the dotted line have completed the challenge and have beaten PatternMatcherBot.

You can calculate the INDEX like this: &lt;pre&gt;(your_score / patternbot_score) * 100.0 &lt;/pre&gt;

Wow, Paul. That&#39;s an amazing result! -- [[PEZ]]

I know, - second place is soooooo strange -- [[Paul Evans]]

=) But without adding a reverse pattern matcher you must probably get used to it. -- [[PEZ]]

Now I&#39;m not sure any longer that you need to run a pattern matcher to get first in this challenge. Though I guess [[rozu]] can improve GlowBlowAPM to a point where it&#39;s impossible to follow without taking the APM path. -- [[PEZ]]

I don&#39;t now. but I think we should add another reference bot to the AntiPatternMatcherChallenge, as iiley already proposed... -- [[rozu]]

Iiley&#39;s bots are open source, and I even just released an &#39;index&#39; version of FloodMini, these could be used as additional tests to these fairly arbitrary ones.  Although I&#39;d guess this side of the challenge would be somewhat more difficult with Aspid&#39;s gun at the center. -- [[Kawigi]]

One amazing thing!!Walls gets 53.2% in 1000 rounds........--unknown

I doubted that last comment&#39;s validity, so I ran it myself... Holy cow! Walls (without firing) got 71.51% of PatternMatcherBot&#39;s score, and won 802 of 1000 rounds.
&lt;pre&gt;
1st: lv.Patt...1.3	67509	9900	1980	51681	3948	0	0	198	802	0
2nd: sample.Walls	48278	40100	8020	0	0	158	0	802	198	0
&lt;/pre&gt;
I added Dookious 0.50&#39;s score to the list, too.
-- [[Voidious]]

I think I&#39;ve done something wrong here... I ran Capriite against the pattern matching bot first in a quick 200 round battle and got 300% with that formula for score, but nobody has higher than 100%. I thought I did something wrong so I ran the whole 500 rounds and got 349%... now I know I did something wrong. What is it?
&lt;pre&gt;
1st: DM.Capriite 3.7.2	        83366	24000	4800	45173	8632	723	36	482	20	0
2nd: lv.PatternMatcherBot 1.3	23875	1000	200	22181	493	0	0	20	480	0
&lt;/pre&gt;
I did seem to win a lot of them, 482 out of 500, 96.4%.
-- [[Damij]]

Welcome to the wiki! Your bot should not fire during this challenge. That&#39;s what&#39;s throwing off your score. --[[wcsv]]

This was a good test of theory.  If I run an anti-pm movement, it will only really dominate against the same pm style gun.  Against Che (for the APMC2K6) LifelongObsession APMC lost 2 out of 500 battles.  Because it runs a reverse-Che-pattern-matcher.  Not all PM guns are created equal!  -- [[Simonton]]

Wow, lesson #2: don&#39;t give up on the theory right away!  :)  This is basically like throwing in a little (anti-) CrowdTargeting: I composed the reverse pattern matcher with reverse head-on-targeting, reverse linear targeting and reverse circular targeting, and now *that* seems to give pretty good results!  I was just telling someone yesterday that when a good idea comes along it seems to come from several people at the same time (read &quot;crowd mevement&quot;).  I&#39;ll leave both results up there for now so y&#39;all can see it clearly, someone can feel free to erase one of them in the near future if they&#39;d like.  -- [[Simonton]]

Simonton, at this rate, your gonna be getting some really evil looks, most notabily when you release this APM + WS bot!

See, if you write a bot that moves exactly how everyone doesn&#39;t expect you to all the time, the bot should probably have a name like DevilsAdvocate. -- [[Kawigi]]

I think I know why walls does so well against EnderPMC. I had the same bug in my micro pattern matcher, I haven&#39;t looked at Ender&#39;s source, but here&#39;s my theory: walls is always on the border, and your bounds checking in the iterative is doing the following: 
&lt;pre&gt;
if(!new Rectangle2D.Double(18,18,getBattleFieldWidth() - 36, getBattleFieldHeight() - 36)
   .contains(enemyX + getX(), enemyY + getY())){
    break;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The problem with this is that the &#39;contains&#39; method does not include the border pixel, so the 18 should be replaced with 17 and the 36 with 32.  -- [[Skilgannon]]

IIRC, the 18 should be fine.  I use something like 35.9999999999 instead of 36 to solve the problem in my pattern matchers. -- [[Simonton]]
