&lt;b&gt;Who am i?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My name is Marcos Machado Coelho de Souza, i was born in Japan 1970, but i am a typical brazilian - Grandparents portuguese + italian (actually, being a typical brazilian means any combination in at least of a dozen original countries: portugal, italy, germany, japan, africa, sweden, native brasilians(indians, being political and geografically incorretct), etc...).&lt;br&gt;

I am a Java Programmer, doing this for my living. I describe myself as a soul-programmer, i really enjoy to sit behind a keyboard and hit its keys as if was Mozart composing (wish u understand what am i saying). Thats probably the major reason of my interest in [[Robocode]]. That and the fascination on making a machine that &quot;thinks&quot; (Probably all RoboCoders enjoy that little god-like sensation - anything serious i hope :-) ).

Bem-vindo ao wiki. :) -- [[ABC]]

Conforme ja havia lhe dito, obrigado. de uma olhada na To-Do list da pagina do [[Musashi]] :-)... -- [[Axe]]

All you know how seriously we take the Carnival here in Brazil, 5 days of holiday! And also all you know how Rio de Janeiro becomes in these days (a lot of turists - 2 million aprox.). So, I&#39;m going to the mountains in that hell-like mean time. See u all soon, good carnival and give a rest to my bots please :)... Specially [[Rozu]]&#39;s [[Aleph]]. Obv, just kiddin&#39;, good carnival to you all that don&#39;t have that holiday! Quoting D&#39;Gaule: &quot;Brazil isn&#39;t a serious country&quot; (at least he was 5-days right..) -- [[Axe]] 
 
Happy Carnival, everybody )))))))))))....  -- [[Axe]]

I have a question to you RoboCoders: Is the real dimensions of a bot 40X40? Think that i&#39;ve saw somewhere that it isn&#39;t really that. Does anybody knows something about it? -- [[Axe]]

Iirc, it&#39;s 36x36. -- [[ABC]]

That was what i thought have seen... But why the api returns 40 then? -- [[Axe]]

Does it? I think you might be the first one who have ever use the API call. =) -- [[PEZ]]

Am I drunk? I&#39;ll check my code... Maybe is the carnival :-) Hic! -- [[Axe]]

Nope, i aint drunk (yet)... I use (probably since i&#39;ve started robocoding): Math.max(this.getHeight(), this.getWidth());... The api javadoc says:
&lt;pre&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getHeight
public double getHeight()Returns the height of the robot 

Returns:
the height of the robot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getWidth
public double getWidth()Returns the width of the robot 

Returns:
the width of the robot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/pre&gt;
And it returns 40X40... Any clues why? -- [[Axe]]

because that&#39;s the width and height of the bot maybe?  The legendary 18 and 36 stuff we&#39;re doing is because Robocode actually subtracts 4 from both of those when doing collision detection, maybe as a sort of averaging between when they&#39;re facing diagonally and facing vertically or horizontally (?) -- [[Kawigi]]

The bot is a non-rotating square according to the developers IIRC, so where you&#39;re facing shouldn&#39;t make a difference.  I can&#39;t believe that 40x40 is correct, my movement code should make me drive into walls constantly...  [[Jamougha]]

My point is that a bot is a 40x40 rotating square according to the developers (ideally), but it&#39;s implemented as a 36x36 non-rotating square. -- [[Kawigi]]

Perhaps... I&#39;m not sure what the difference is. :-) Anyhow, I just tested and a bot can approach to within 18.0001 pixels of the wall or so, so 36x36 is a good assumption. -- [[Jamougha]]

I had a gun that couldn&#39;t hit walls once because he would be within 17.999999999 pixels of the wall and it screwed it up. -- [[Kawigi]]

It&#39;s a non-rotating square? Are u sure? I mean, it isn&#39;t linked to the graphical representation? -- [[Axe]]

Interesting... it&#39;s really a 36X36, there is the code:
&lt;pre&gt;
public synchronized void updateBoundingBox()
{
  boundingBox.setRect((x - (double)(width / 2)) + 2D, 
      (y - (double)(height / 2)) + 2D, width - 4, height - 4);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Where width=height=40... Weird... -- [[Axe]]

Beware u all robocoderes... I´m preparing a disciple: Caeser. He promisses(?). Time will tell... -- [[Axe]]

I have a problem with all of your bots. Not a single one runs on my computer.Everytime when i try to run a battle with a robot i get this:&lt;pre&gt;SYSTEM: Could not load axeBots.SilverSurfer 1.01 : java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: axeBots/SilverSurfer (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)

I use Java 1.3 . Is this a possible reason for throwing this exception or what am i doing wrong. --[[deathcon]]

Thnx for reporting. Probably is the JRE version, [[ABC]] also gave me this warning. I&#39;ll try to fix it for 1.3 as soon as possible, the problem is that i&#39;m around with some WaveSurfing problem... -- [[Axe]]

Just installed java 1.4 and no more problems. :D  --[[deathcon]]

It&#39;s a good step i think. Many others bots have the same compatibility issue... I have to solve this to make it 1.3 compatible, but this kind of stuff always loose priority (it´s not that fun u know:). -- [[Axe]]

Dude, I do receive your e-mail letters. It must be you not receiving mine. -- [[PEZ]]
* It was that spam killer... I don&#39;t know what is worst: the disease or the cure. -- [[Axe]] 

Hey you all dudes! Just to remember that I remember u all, and hopefully u all remember me too... (remember-boring i know) I have some new ideas and thoughts that are screaming to go out, but i&#39;m facing now an awfully long and hard time. But u all know too, after the storm the good times allways shine! &quot;It can&#39;t rain alltimes...&quot; (sic-to me) (or !hics! maybe? - definately it&#39;s written PORTO on the bottle, [[PEZ]]! Actually on all of them:). God Bless U All, see u soon! -- [[Axe]]   

Man, that doesn&#39;t sound good. Well, it sounds like it tastes good. Maybe it&#39;s with Ports as it is with Burboun, you need to break a few bottles before they really get to ya. =) Hope to see you back on the scene soon! -- [[PEZ]]

Hope to see you back soon Axe, well as long as you keep from pushing us down in the rankings that is ;-) Same goes for you ABC! -- [[Pulsar]]

Too late for that... ;) -- [[ABC]]

Hey ya! Good to &quot;see&quot; u all! Hails from Brazil!&lt;br&gt;
Congrats for the 3rd place, [[ABC]]! Aiming the crown?&lt;br&gt;
U have work to do now, [[Pulsar]] ;). Answering your question, im not planning anything by now... Too much work, no time for fun now. But maybe ahead we will try something, i definately(?) miss robocoding...&lt;/br&gt;
Again, salutes to u all robocoders. Build the best, destroy the rest! -- [[Axe]]
  
I&#39;m always aiming for the crown, who isn&#39;t? ;) Take your time to return, I had (almost) forgotten how tiring robocode can be, when you&#39;r not coding you are thinking about what to try next. It&#39;s an obsession! -- [[ABC]]

Yeah u are right, indeed... It´s in the blood, isn´t? Or you do it deeply, or u better don´t do it at all. The night that [[Pulsar]] wrote me his post, i already noticed that u where(was?) doing updates. Tryied to post a response like that: &quot;ABC seems back, if i where(?) u all, I´ll start to shake, I´´ll start to coff..&quot;. But i´ve got problems in my connection, and later was too late... Like the crowd use to shout here, in the Maracanã after a goal: &quot;Haaaaá! Eu Já sabiaaaaaaá!&quot;. ;) Keep on pushing up the limits!&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;For those about to robocode, we salute you!!!&lt;/b&gt; -- [[Axe]] 

Btw, a question to u all robocoders: I was thinking in putting, in a temporary base, [[SilverFist]] back. Only to see where it would stand, and after that i´ll take it out. Anyone have a problem with that? [[PEZ]] (where r u, man...)? -- [[Axe]] 

I definitely have no problem with that! As a newcomer to Robocode, I&#39;ve only read about this legendary monster, and I&#39;d love to get to see it in action :) (From what I understand, PEZ is &lt;A HREF=&quot;https://www.halowiki.net&quot;&gt;playing Halo&lt;/A&gt;.) -- [[Voidious]]

Naughty boy that [[PEZ]], ain´t him? I´ll try to contact him anyway, let´s see if those old adresses that i have r still valid...&lt;br&gt;
Welcome to the battle, [[Voidious]]! Very impressive that #32 for a first bot. Keep the good work, new quality blood is a bless. -- [[Axe]] 

Yes, SilverFist is always welcome. We made an interesting experiment a while ago, AShadow (Shadow&#39;s movement + Ascendant&#39;s gun). I don&#39;t know if you saw it, but the result was AShadow &gt; Ascendant. ;) -- [[ABC]]

Lots of Halo 2 for this guy, yes. And even more maintaing https://halowiki.net and my Halo 2 clan (https://clanofbobs.org/). Halo 2 is cool in many ways, but it is far from as friendly as the Robocode scene. I miss you guys! And I will probably now try to put some focus back on Robocode. How fun could it be for an [[Ascendant]] without something to ascend? =) -- [[PEZ]]

HA! The old and good [[PEZ]], now a.k.a. &quot;Halo man&quot;? :)
I´ll take a look at that Halo stuff, if it´s good for [[PEZ]]... But my guts says that RC is invencible! Even i´m beeing more than a year far from the rc coding, I still sometimes catch myself wondering about angles, neural and statistic approachs for aiming &amp; moving...&lt;br&gt;
But as i said, for the next weeks i´ll be just the Work-Axe-Holic, no time for fun-coding (althought i still squeeze some time for Beers, friends &amp; women). Beeing a single again since dec-2005, it´s time for changing, the rock must roll, &quot;O mundo gira, a Lusitana roda!&quot; (i really dont think that this can be easily translated, perhaps ABC could). As PEZ, im trying new games too, Kenjutso &amp; Kendo, and its sometimes amazing how life imitates the code... Sword fighting aint that different from robocoding at all!
Talk 2 much, i now. 2 much from me, i now 2. But as PEZ, I miss you guys 2! (2 much 2s? Or 2 much much&lt;i&gt;es&lt;/i&gt;? :))&lt;br&gt;
Well, ill try a taste of rc today, [[PEZ]] agreed with my little [[SilverFist]] test, and since no one was against it... I´ll remove it when stable in rank, so it´s only a test. But i´m curious about how it will perform in this new environment. This is the old version, from 2004 september, i think. No updates at all. I think that it reached 2078. Lets see now. -- [[Axe]]

SilverFist ended afterall w/ 2045 pts., irc, it was 2078 more than a(n?) year ago. It was a King at his time, but now it ended in a draw with SilverSurfer at 5th... The competition is definately toughter... -- [[Axe]]
