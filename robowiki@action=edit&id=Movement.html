<textarea name="text"  rows="20" cols="65" wrap="virtual" style="width:100%">Movement is one of the two most important parts of a robot (the other being [[Targeting]]).  It is how your robot moves around the battlefield.  Your Movement is what stops the enemy&#39;s Targeting from correctly guessing where you will be when a bullet reaches you.

The implementation of a movement system may well find a specific point it wants to move to.  To do that you need a goTo() method.  You can find out more on /CodeSnippetGoTo, /CodeSnippetBasicGoTo and /GoToBot

----
==== PatternMovement ====
* LinearMovement - Moving in a straight line.  Vulnerable to LinearTargeting.
* [[Oscillators]] - Moving in a set pattern, which repeats (although the period can be hundreds of ticks long).  Vulnerable to PatternMatching.
* CircleBots - Moves in circles. Vulnerable to CircularTargeting.
* WallBots - Moves along the walls. Vulnerable to LinearTargeting, except when near corners.
* RamBots - Moves to hit the enemy.  Vulnerable to most targeting, but gets extra ram bonus.
* StopAndGo - Movement reacts on enemyfire. Effective against LinearTargeting and CircularTargeting, vulnerable to PatternMatching and GuessFactorTargeting.

==== OneOnOneMovement ====

* AntiGravityMovement - Works by imagining forces repeling your robot from the other robots, and the walls.  Works well in Melee &amp; 1on1.
* [[PerpendicularMovement]] - A general term describing a lot of movements systems.  They move at right angles to the enemy so their bearing changes as much as possible.
** RandomMovement - Moves in a randomly determined way, often combined with other techniques to avoid moving in undesirable ways. Check RandomMovementBot for an implementation.
** DynamicDistancing - selecting a distance from the enemy using past experience.
** [[CircleStrafing]]
* [[Cannibals]] - Copy the direction of the enemy (often using MirrorMovement). Vulnerable to AntiMirrorTargeting, and to bad enemy movement.
* ProvocativeMovement - Moving in a way that aids your Targeting, rather than harming your enemy&#39;s.
* ChaoticMovement - Similar to RandomMovement, in that is moves in a completely unpredictable way.
* [[ArbitraryMovement]] - Moves in an arbitary, but often unpredictable way.
* [[NeuralReinforcementLearningMovement]] - Moves in a learned fashion, using a NeuralNetwork
* TrackMovement
* FlatMovement - Moving in such a way that all possible targeting methods should hit roughly equally. (Creating a &quot;flat&quot; graph if one were to graph the movement.)
* WaveSurfing - Moving with respect to where bullets are fired from, usually combined with GuessFactor data about how the enemy has hit you.
** [[WaveSurfing/TrueSurf|True Surfing]] - Continually re-evaluates moving forwards or backwards, &quot;surfing&quot; [[EnemyWave]]s similarly to a real surfer.
** [[WaveSurfing/GoToStyle|GoTo-Style]] - Calculates the range it could get to before the closest wave &quot;breaks&quot;, and goes to the safest part of the wave (or all waves).
** [[WaveSurfing/ShrapnelSurf|Shrapnel Surfing]] - Calculates the most dangerous part of the oncoming wave(s), and moves furthest from that area.
** [[WaveSurfing/ReverseForwardSensors|Reverse/Forward Sensors]] - A form of [[WaveSurfing/TrueSurf|True Surfing]] that does *not* use [[WaveSurfing/PrecisePrediction|Precise Prediction]], but tries to approximate similar results.
** [[WaveSurfing/Experiments|Experiments]] - Miscellaneous WaveSurfing experiments.
** [[WaveSurfing/PrecisePrediction|Precise Prediction]] - Using very precise prediction code to get extremely exact results from your WaveSurfing. Could be used in any of the WaveSurfing methodologies.
==== MeleeMovement ====
* CornerMovement
* AntiGravityMovement - Works by imagining forces repeling your robot from the other robots, and the walls.  Works well in Melee &amp; 1on1.
* MinimumRiskMovement - Picks a selection of possible moves, and follows the run with least risk (ie. furthest from enemies)
* BombSheltering - in [[melee]], hides behind weak enemy bots to avoid being hit
* WantedTerrain
----
&#39;&#39;&#39;Challenges&#39;&#39;&#39;
* MovementChallenge - Test your movement in a controlled environment.
** CurveFlatteningChallenge: Try to avoid being hit by one of the GuessFactor guns around (in days long past).
** AntiPatternMatcherChallenge: Try to avoid being hit by the champion of the PatternMatcherChallenge.
* MovementChallenge2K6 - Updated with some much scarier guns.
** WaveSurfingChallenge2K6 - Test your movement against HeadOnTargeting, LinearTargeting, and CircularTargeting.
** CurveFlatteningChallenge2K6 - Try to avoid being hit by three excellent GuessFactor guns.
** AntiPatternMatcherChallenge2K6 - Try to avoid being hit by a potent PatternMatching gun.
* WaveSurfingChallenge: Can you dodge *every* bullet these bots fire?
* PassiveKillChallenge: 
* SampleBotChallenge/Movement: 1 Movement, 11 SampleBots, 0% hit rate. Can it be done?

&#39;&#39;&#39;Other&#39;&#39;&#39;
* FuturePosition - a code snippet to work out where your movement system will take you.
* WallAvoidance
* MultiMode
* [[Saving]]
* [[Teleport]]
