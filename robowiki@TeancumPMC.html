<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>A tuning excercise on <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>'s gun, currently rating 98.55 on the PMCIndex for <a href="robowiki@Vic" class=wikipagelink>Vic</a>'s <a href="robowiki@PatternMatcherChallenge" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatcherChallenge</a>.  This is probably the best of anyone who used a relative pattern-matcher (like <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>'s).  It would be interesting if he next made a unit test for a relative pattern-matcher and challenged us with it ;-)
<p>
It's built on the exact same concepts as <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>'s gun.  There's the mod fix I mentioned, a round-by-round storing mechanism, some tweaking on the order of computation (I think it's more correct now), I did 10 rounds of data saving to just get that extra 1% on the /PMCIndex<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TeancumPMC/PMCIndex" class=wikipageedit>?</a> (I took it out of the dev version of <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>, because he just couldn't save enough data to make it worth it), but it's still the same pattern-matcher.  It still finds patterns in an opponent's movement relative to itself, so it takes it a little longer to get <a href="robowiki@PatternBot" class=wikipagelink>PatternBot</a>, who is completely oblivious to him.  He can be somewhat inaccurate if he's never seen the movement from a similar angle before.  However he can still score up to a 94% hit rate (95%+ maybe if he has saved data) against <a href="robowiki@PatternBot" class=wikipagelink>PatternBot</a> over 100 rounds.  I played with some things to hit <a href="robowiki@PatternBot" class=wikipagelink>PatternBot</a> in the beginning better, but nothing was overly effective, so I scrapped it.  The dev version has a bi-directional pattern-matcher, which I took out in this version.  The purpose of the bi-directional pattern-matcher was to be able to see if I recognized a pattern that was exactly opposite (negative) of the pattern I'm searching for in regards to LateralVeloctiy<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=LateralVeloctiy" class=wikipageedit>?</a> (but the same in <a href="robowiki@AdvancingVelocity" class=wikipagelink>AdvancingVelocity</a>).  It didn't really help against <a href="robowiki@PatternBot" class=wikipagelink>PatternBot</a> specifically, though, and I probably mis-identified a few patterns with it, too.  And it took some overhead to do.  The dev version also handles projection into a wall by firing a faster bullet that would be timed to hit my opponent as he hit the wall (for lack of knowledge of what he would do next).  In this version, I just broke out of the loop and didn't adjust bullet power.  This version is also the king of skipping turns, partially because of the length of patterns I try to match (of course, it's only up to 50).  It also uses <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a>'s radar instead of <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>'s real radar.  Still interpolates missed scans the same way.
<p>
Things that will propagate into the real <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>:
<UL >
<li> Fixing the mod problem - that should significantly improve his performance in battles over 50 or 60 rounds.
<li> Round-by-round pattern buffer - This should improve his accuracy in general against really any opponent.
<li> Computational ordering
</UL>
<p>
Things that I probably won't put into the next release of <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>:
<UL >
<li> I'll probably reinsert the adjustment of bullet power to hit people as they hit the wall, or I could project them 'bouncing' off the wall.  Given space, I'll do more complex analysis of it.  This is even more likely to happen with <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a>.
<li> Leaving out the data saving.  The way I do it now, it takes 140 KB to save data from 10 rounds.  Not worth it.
<li> Probably will shorten the match length (so people don't hate me).
<li> Might revert to a smaller radar system.
</UL>

Nitpicking on the choice of words, <a href="robowiki@PatternBot" class=wikipagelink>PatternBot</a> is hardly a unit test. It's rather a functional test. A unit test tests a unit of code by calling its methods, feeding it input and asserting for expected output/behaviour. Typically you can use JUnit to write unit tests for Java code. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

Kawigi, i read here that you managed to save the data for your pattern matching gun (and disgarded this feature again because of the file size). I am trying to save my data aswel, in the hope that it gives <a href="robowiki@Fenrir" class=wikipagelink>Fenrir</a> an edge in short battles. Unfortunately saving data for a patternmatching gun is a bit more difficult than just saving some guesfactors. I save 5000 samples out of the total arrays, and the result is a worse performance...(a match percentage of 95% (with variable patternsize) drops to 0%) I haven't pinpointed the problem yet. It may be caused by the small amount of samples or a discontinuity in the signal between the saved data and the new data. The strange thing is that the worse performance persists even in a large number (&gt;200) of rounds. 
<p>
Can you explain how you implemented this? Maybe it can help me or trigger a new approach. thanks -- <a href="robowiki@Loki" class=wikipagelink>Loki</a>

<li> I currently think the problem is due to a unintentional change in the data format after saveing/reloading the data. Probably due to a (automatic) cast? I will publish the saving/retreiving code at the <a href="robowiki@Fenrir" class=wikipagelink>Fenrir</a> page, maybe you see the error straight away. --<a href="robowiki@Loki" class=wikipagelink>Loki</a>

You might be able to use the approach I took with <a href="robowiki@LeachPMC/Code" class=wikipagelink>LeachPMC/Code</a>. The <a href="robowiki@LeachPMC" class=wikipagelink>LeachPMC</a> page holds some discussion around the subject as well. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Pez, thanks for your suggestion. If i can't solve my problem, maybe i will try a similar approach of storing all info at a certain tick in one object. The advantage is that all related data is always in the same object, the disadvantage is that i can rewrite my pattern matching code and still don't understand what i did wrong... ;-) --<a href="robowiki@Loki" class=wikipagelink>Loki</a>
