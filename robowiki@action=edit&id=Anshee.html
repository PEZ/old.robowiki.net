Just saw this name on the uploaders list for the rumble....welcome to the wiki, and introduce youself! -- [[Skilgannon]]

* Um... should this page be named &quot;Banshee&quot;, not &quot;Anshee&quot;? -- [[AaronR]]
* I was just wondering that - the bot package is &quot;banshee&quot;, but the [http://thekandieman.com/nfwu/rr-uploads.php uploader&#39;s list] says &quot;Anshee&quot;... Anyway, whenever he/she introduces him/herself, I can rename the page if necessary. =) -- [[Voidious]]
* Maybe his/her first initial is &quot;B&quot;? -- [[AaronR]]

[2007-11-10]
Hello :-) Sorry it took me a few days, but I never suspected the community here to be so active and welcome for newcomers: I came here today to found a page only to find out that it already exists :-)
So the short intro part: my real name is Maciej Hrynczyszyn, I live in Pozna&amp;#324;, Poland and I work as Java developer.
As for whether whether it should be &#39;banshee&#39; or &#39;anshee&#39;: I chose &#39;anshee&#39; for uploading results because roborumble client told me &#39;banshee&#39; was already taken. But it doesn&#39;t really matter, I use both versions regularly. So for me it can stay like it is.

I started off with a very simple bot (banshee.mini.Nexus6), dusting off my math skills in the development process (who would think one forgets trigonometry so fast...?). The important thing is the rule I imposed on self at the beginning of development: I don&#39;t peek into others&#39; code (or at least at the very minimum...), I want to implement all basic to intermediate stuff: (from linear, circular guns, to &#39;prediction&#39; systems: surfing or bullet avoidance in general, targeting based on statistical analysis) all by myself. Only after that phase I&#39;ll look for others&#39; ideas to stea^Wborrow :-)

This approach, I believe, will give me most fun while robocoding. On the other hand though, this probably greatly delays the moment my bots will pose any serious threat, but that&#39;s something my ego can live with for a while :-) But don&#39;t taunt me, please, if my next few releases keep hanging around 400 ;-)

Cheers and thanks for the welcome! :-) -- [[Anshee]]

Anytime. =) Here&#39;s a couple things I&#39;d like to point out:

# You don&#39;t have to sign your posts with the date. The wiki logs all changes automatically.
# [[LinearTargeting]], [[CircularTargeting]], [[RandomMovement]], and [[PatternMatching]] are all easy to implement without stea^Wborrowing anyone&#39;s code. However, when you get up to the level of [[GuessFactorTargeting]] and [[WaveSurfing]], definitely consider looking at the tutorials. I know I never would have gotten anywhere with [[Horizon]] without the [[WaveSurfing/Tutorial|WaveSurfing tutorial]] and [[BasicSurfer]].

Again, welcome! =)

&#39;&#39;Edit: One more thing - if you change your name in the [http://robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki?action=editprefs Preferences] page, it will appear on the [[Changes]] log and the View other revisions page.&#39;&#39;

Welcome! Don&#39;t be afraid to be &#39;slow&#39; on improvements. It took me two-and-a-half years before I earned the membership of the prestigious [[The2000Club]]. Learning it like I did makes you keen of little details that get more important once you rise in the rankings.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

I first learned of Robocode from a friend who also said that once he started looking at other peoples&#39; code, all the fun went away.  I started coding Ugluk in .. (checks the source code backup for Ugluk v0.0.1) October 2nd, 2005.  So two years now, though I take breaks on occasion.  The highest I&#39;ve reached ratings wise is ~1840, but it&#39;s 100% me.  If not, it wouldn&#39;t really be mine.  -- [[Martin Alan Pedersen|Martin]] / [[Ugluk]]

Welcome to the wiki! It seems everybody brings their own style as to how they most enjoy Robocode. As for me, I am an advocate of OpenSource code (and all of my bots are), but I also find myself far less likely to peek at competitors&#39; code as time goes on. I sort of see Robocode as a similar field to mathematics - few (if any?) mathematicians can become experts without studying the work of those who came before. I also think it&#39;s a great idea to start with more basic methods before working up to WaveSurfing and statistical targeting methods; sometimes I look back at the time when I was working my way through the early stuff as almost more fun than anything since. In any case, enjoy and feel free to ask questions. Cheers, -- [[Voidious]]

Hey, welcome, don&#39;t worry if your botstart out low! We&#39;ve all been there in the 1400&#39;s (well most), I mainly do independent research into strange ideas, only a few have payed off. My best bot is buggy-ish. --[[Chase-san]]

@AaronR: Yeah, I know, I just wanted to set a clearly visible timeline to the discussion. IMHO wikis, while great for collaborative development of single-themed pages (wikipedia, c2) are a disaster for tracking any kind of more advanced discussion (for similar reasons like forums and blogs by the way). I still prefer Usenet for that, but it might be just me :-)

@Grubbm: You relaxed me a bit with this 2.5 years remark :-) It&#39;s a hobby afterall, after a workweek it&#39;s really refreshing to switch to &#39;ready when it&#39;s ready&#39; approach (yes, I use Debian ;-)) By the way, your gh.mini.GrubbmOne was one of the first bots I compared against, with, errr, less than so-so results. As it turned out it&#39;s one of the most problematic opponents for Nexus6 :-) That&#39;s because Nexus is extremely vulnerable against bots that have circular targeting (like GOne, right?) and, at the same time, which movement cause Nexus to stabilize in near-circular ellipses, I guess.

* Hooray! Another Linux user =). Posting from Gutsy Gibbon... -- [[Skilgannon]]

@Martin: Yeah, same here: every line of _my_ code has to be _my_ way: I must know in detail what it does and why it&#39;s there. I think that&#39;s just a programmers&#39; thing: they are control freaks about their work :-)

@Voidious: Your&#39;re absolutely right about experts having to know what&#39;d been done in their field before. That&#39;s why when I&#39;m about to become one (;-)) I&#39;ll certainly look for more direct inspiration. But that&#39;s a long to Tipperary :-) And about [[OpenSource]]: in short: me too. I just didn&#39;t want to come out pathetic attaching a license to something so simple as Nexus6 (source files are included in the jar anyway). BTW, is it customary here? ie. that bots carry a certain license?

* A lot of us (myself included) use the [[RWPCL]]. Some people use other ones, like the GPL, the [[KawigiPublicLicense]], or the [[RWLPCL]], some just release it with no license, and others just attach a small note, like &quot;please share improvements&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t just copy my whole bot and tweak it&quot;. -- [[Voidious]]

@Chase-san: About experimenting: That&#39;s the one more reason for robocoding for me: It might give me opportunity to check out some ideas I&#39;ve been thinking about since studies but never really had practical motivation to implement. This is mainly stuff connected with classification systems: rough sets, rules extraction, various data discretization methods... We&#39;ll see if manage to go so far :-)
