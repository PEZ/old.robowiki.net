<a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

My best bot so far.
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

<PRE >
 **9/30/05: Version 1.1.0 is ranked 27th in the RR with 1903 points.**
 9/20/05: The first release is ranked 39th in the RR with 1814.06 points.
</PRE>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It uses my own implementation of <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>. (The movement still needs a lot of work!)
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

Stampede2 uses a multi-buffered <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> gun.
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It tries to <a href="robowiki@WaveSurf" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurf</a>, but is only partially successful right now.
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

No melee at all.
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

It saves firing and avoidance statistics between rounds and nothing between matches.
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

I couldn't think of a name, so I took the easy way out and named it after my previous bot.
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Not yet.
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

<PRE >
 -Fix the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>.
 -Break the 1900 mark. -DONE 9/30/05
 -Break the 2k mark.
 -Do some other stuff.
</PRE>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

cx.* pretty much sums it up - they are a strong collection of bots!
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

It isn't directly based on any bot (maybe I used a few snippets from <a href="robowiki@Stampede" class=wikipagelink>Stampede</a>, my previous robot), but many of the ideas I used were inspired by things that I read here. All of the code however, is completely of my own creation.

Congratulations on breaking the 1900-barrier, you really do leap forward. --<a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Thanks, I fixed a few big bugs in the movement which helped a lot. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
<p>
Hmmm... what's a multi-buffered guess-factor gun? :-) -- <a href="robowiki@Jamougha" class=wikipagelink>Jamougha</a>
<p>
Heh, I wondered the same thing myself, but figured I was just new enough to this to not understand. ;) My best guess was that it might use multiple sets of segmentations and choose between or average them, or something? -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Yes, that is right. It uses multiple stat buffers, with equal numbers of bins in each, that use different methods of segmentation; then it just combines the corresponding bins from each buffer and fires at the highest peak produced by this process. Having the statistics broken up like this helps to reduce the gun's learning time and also allows me to choose various segmentations that may work against different movement styles. I think there are other bots that use similar systems, but I can't think of them right now. I'll write a more detailed description later if you want, but for now I have to get back to studying for finals.
--<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> definitely uses multiple, weighted stat buffers for the movement. Sounds like we're in similar boats, wcsv... I've been resisting Robocode until tonight, having had my two toughest finals today. Precisely this is what I'm working on right now for Dookious... -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
