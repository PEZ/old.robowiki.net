==== Author ====

[[Voidious]] and [[PEZ]], assembled by [[Bayen]]

==== Extends ====

AdvancedRobot

==== Description ====

BasicGFSurfer is the merge between two bots: [[PEZ]]&#39;s GFTargetingBot and [[Voidious]]&#39; BasicSurfer. More info can be found there.

More info can also be found at [[Kawigi]]&#39;s [[GuessFactorTargeting/Tutorial|GuessFactorTargeting Tutorial]] and on [[Voidious]]&#39; [[WaveSurfing/Tutorial|WaveSurfing Tutorial]].

==== What&#39;s special about it? ====

Nothing, it is the basic, bugfree, implementation of a WaveSurfer with GuessFactorTargeting

==== Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it? ====

http://www.freewebs.com/bayen/files/wiki.BasicGFSurfer_1.0.jar&lt;br&gt;
http://home.versatel.nl/gheijenk/robocode/jarfiles/wiki.BasicGFSurfer_1.01.jar

==== How competitive is it? ====

It is ranked just in the top-50 with 1865 points

==== How does it [[Movement|move]]? ====

basic WaveSurfing

==== How does it fire? ====

basic segmented GuessFactorTargeting

==== How does it [[DodgingBullets|dodge bullets]]? ====

WaveSurfing

==== How does the [[Melee|melee]] strategy differ from [[OneOnOne|one-on-one]]  strategy? ====

Not aware of melee

==== What does it save between rounds and matches? ===

Between rounds anything usefull, between matches nothing.

==== Where did you get the name? ====

Well, I think that is rather clear, isn&#39;t it.

==== Can I use your code? ====

This comes from the tutorials, so it is in the jar. Public domain. The authors all enjoy credits though.

==== What&#39;s next for this robot? ====

Nothing. It fullfills its purpose as it is.

==== Does it have any [[WhiteWhale]]s? ====

Nope.

==== What other robot(s) is it based on? ====

Reread this page, it is mentioned at the top.

==== Comments, questions, feedback: ====

This bot is stronger than expected.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

Yeah, it&#39;s stronger than my [[Squirrel]], which was SUPPOSED to take that code and improve it but all it did was make it worse :(. --[[Bayen]]

I don&#39;t think the tutorials are under the [[RWPCL]], I fiugured the code was just to use and abuse for anything thats sports your fancy. (not that my bots aren&#39;t under the RWPCL anyway) -- [[Chase-san]]

[[PEZ]] put GFTargetingBot under the [[RWPCL]], but I consider the [[WaveSurfing/Tutorial]] to be available to use however you want. -- [[Voidious]]

I lifted the RWPCL licensing now. The code is in the public domain. Of course I do believe very hard in OpenSource and would encourage anyone to use it anyway. -- [[PEZ]]

I put Squirrel&#39;s code in the jar, so that makes it open source, right?  Anyway, I don&#39;t think anyone would really want to use my code, for two reasons.  It&#39;s extremely messy, and Squirrel isn&#39;t that good.  Oh well --[[Bayen]]

* Yes, that makes it open source ;) -- [[Voidious]]

Hmm, when i run [[Plains]] against BasicGFSurfer, i sometimes get a

I can see why - it has MAX_DISTANCE set to 900, but technically the maximum distance should be 1000 - BOT_WIDTH (because it measures from center of the bot) on an 800x600 field (like a 3/4/5 right triangle). If you are as far away as possible, it will be a higher index than the stat buffer is initialized with. Really, the safest thing to do would be to calculate MAX_DISTANCE based on battlefield width and height. Hopefully, that stoppage thing is also related. I&#39;ll update the GFTargetingBot tutorial; somebody should release a BasicSurfer 1.1 =) -- [[Voidious]]
* Maybe the introduction should be changed to read, &quot;... the basic, buggy implementation of a WaveSurfer with GuessFactorTargeting ...&quot;. =P -- [[AaronR]]

Bugfixed version 1.01 available. Made a more robust fix than just increasing the distance, without any effect on distances &lt; 900. MAX_DISTANCE remains 900.
&lt;pre&gt;
int distanceIndex = Math.min(DISTANCE_INDEXES-1, (int)(distance / (MAX_DISTANCE / DISTANCE_INDEXES)));
&lt;/pre&gt;
