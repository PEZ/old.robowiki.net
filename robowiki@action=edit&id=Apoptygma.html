Apoptygma 0.4 released. Bugfix, few minor changes, colours removed. Primarily a maintenance release for speed and stability. Should allow Apoptygma to operate nearer it&#39;s full potential. Sorry to everyone whose RR@H clients were ground to a halt by 0.3.

----
Old News:

WOOHOO! I made it work. *dances like a maniac*
Apoptygma 0.3 features:
*Multi-variable non-symbolic pattern matcher
*Simply segmented absolute guess factor gun
*Virtual bullets based virtualguns system
*Pretty colours
*No compromises (unless you count movement)

On the competitiveness aspect... StatGun is Apoptygma 0.3 without colours and with one more line of cleanup code.

StatGun doesn&#39;t skip myriads of turns and occasionally freeze like Apoptygma 0.3 does.

StatGun is codesize 771 (without colours) :(

 1st: arthord.StatGun           	4317	1350	270	2292	404	0	0	27	8	0
 2nd: arthord.micro.Apoptygma 0.3	1821	400	80	1267	74	0	0	10	27	0

Given another 22 bytes Apoptygma could be a competitor, but for now it stands as a successful experiment in miniaturization. As well as pretty. ;)
----
Older News:

A new test robot by [[Kuuran]], a first draft plus one minor revision (version 0.2) is ready and vaguely competitive. This robot tests how complex systems can fit in a micro, currently it boasts a VB based stat gun in a VB based virtual gun array along with one other gun. The original spec also called for a pattern matcher, which looked like it would fit, but in the last minute it had to be cut. This is a priority to get in before version 1.0.

To be uploaded and added to competition as soon as the repository is back up.

==== What&#39;s special about it? ====
I believe this is the most complex weapon system any micro to date has boasted, though that is somewhat debatable as the stat gun is still pretty raw.

==== Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it? ====
http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1688

==== How competitive is it? ====
Top 30 micros. Not amazingly. The movement is poor.

==== How does it [[Movement|move]]? ====
The bot remains perpendicular to it&#39;s opponent at all times. The bot chooses a random distance in a random direction and moves it.

==== How does it fire? ====
It determines whether it&#39;s better to use pattern matching or stats to fire at an opponent, and does so.

==== How does it [[DodgingBullets|dodge bullets]]? ====
Not applicable.

==== How does the [[Melee|melee]] strategy differ from [[OneOnOne|one-on-one]]  strategy? ====
Not applicable.

==== How does it select a target to attack/avoid in [[Melee|melee]]? ====
Not applicable.

==== What does it save between rounds and matches? ===
Not applicable.

==== Where did you get the name? ====
It came off my playlist, Apoptygma Berzerk is a band I am somewhat fond of.

==== Can I use your code? ====
Because of the nature of the pattern matcher I&#39;m afraid I lied about open sourcing it. This matcher could allow for a re-engineering of the NanoSatan line, so I&#39;m going to sit on it for a bit longer.

==== What&#39;s next for your robot? ====
Fix the memory leak it seems to have.
Probably remove colours, fix an inherent instability in the matcher (you&#39;ll see it wig out occasionally), statistically segment the matcher ala Tron, add more stat segments.

==== Does it have any [[WhiteWhale]]s? ====
Plenty, it&#39;s poor movement makes it&#39;s performance against simple guns with good dodging (generally poor scoring robots) quite weak.

==== What other robot(s) is it based on? ====
Not applicable. Though I suppose any Minibot statist owes some heritage to SandboxMini in concept.

==== Comments, questions, feedback: ====

Wow, looks like the number of Micro-statists has tripled in the last couple weeks :-p.  It never occured to me to try and combine it with a PM, though (probably because of the complexity/number of dimensions of my stat gun). -- [[Kawigi]]

I guess knowing you&#39;d need to do it better than DuelistMicro scared people off :p. As a pure stat gun goes FMicro is a far stronger - and thus far bigger - bot, this gun is running practically unsegmented. The big experiment I&#39;m trying here is to squeeze virtualguns into a micro rather than to try and make a super-competitive bot, but right now I&#39;m not having too much luck either way (hopefully it&#39;ll be both when I&#39;m done ;) -- [[Kuuran]]

... and since the VirtualGuns minis that I know of can be counted on one finger... (of course, it might have been done before...) -- [[Kawigi]]
