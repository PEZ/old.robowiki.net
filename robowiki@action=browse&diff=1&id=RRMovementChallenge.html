<div class=wikitext>I figured since we had a Roborumble gun challenge that we should also have a roborumble movement challenge
<p>
Now I noticed that the actual number score you got really tells people nothing, so I came up with two different methods of scoring, one is based on the rank and the other on the score.
<p>
For this challenge your robot will not fire, at all, not at all, not a single bullet, not even end game when the other is disabled (ramming at that point is totally legal though). I was partly inspired by the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/Experiments" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/Experiments</a>, where the surfer does not fire, perhaps later we can add a part where we use a default gun (like Raiko's), but considering how badass Raiko's gun is, I decided to forgo it entirely.
<p>
Both these ranking systems are to help keep the ranks a little more steady over time. So that when someone adds their score a year from now it will still matter some.
<p>
<UL >
<li> Rank % = 100-(Rank / Total Enemies in rumble * 100)
<li> Score % = Robots Score / Top Score in the Rumble at the time * 100
</UL>
<p>
Round to the nearest thousanth.
<p>
I am not yet sure how to order them, as they have two different ranks.
<p>

<p>
Also note, Moron if it didn't fire would get a -24.336% in the Score column because its the only bot that has a negative rank. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

<strong>Comments, complaints, and why didn't you discuss this before you made it?</strong>
<p>
It came to me at the spur of the moment. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
So "score" = "rating", right? (Moron doesnt have a "negative rank", I don't think.) I'm thinking that having something that is (your rating / top rating) is really thrown off by the fact that all <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> ratings have 1600 arbitrarily added to them; 1600 / 2000 would be 80%, but it really was 0 / 400 before the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> simply added 1600 to both sides. It just means 1200 and 2000 are 60% and 100% instead of -100% and 100% (still scales linearly and all), but I think the latter is a lot closer to the "truth" for this percentage. A 1200 rating isn't really 60% of 2000 in any meaningful way, but it is -100% from average while 2000 is +100% from average.
<p>
Other than that, it's an interesting challenge. I think dropping in a decent gun would be a more objective test of one's movement, but not all challenges have to be a <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> benchmark! <em>Edit: I know 2000 isn't the top rank, but it is for my example. =)</em>

Right score, so you suggest subtracting 1600 from all of it?, so moron would have a 'score' of -2126, and be in the Negative2100Club. ;) --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
