<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Nice.  I was planning to add these things to my surfing as soon as I get the current bugs out.  Is this open source?

<UL >
<li> Absolutely, my code is completely free to use. Look at the event handlers in the movement component, that is where all the code for the enemy bullet-fire detection is. The only thing is that the wall hit detection/damage calculation I took from <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, so give some credit to <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a> too. -- <a href="robowiki@AaronR" class=wikipagelink>AaronR</a>
<li> You may want to add one more feature, and that is to only accept <a href="robowiki@EnemyWaves" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWaves</a> being fired when their <a href="robowiki@GunHeat" class=wikipagelink>GunHeat</a> is 0. It eliminates 95% of wallhit waves. Of course, I also have the accurate tracking of enemy energy, using bullet bonus and bullet damage. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

Umm... for the 400th time in a row, <em>that was dumb</em>. I just noticed a bug that explains why the scores didn't go up as much as they should have when I released 1.0beta10. I made the bot treat "stop" as moving in the previous direction, but I forgot to initialize the direction variable at the start of each round. By Java convention, a variable is automatically initialized to 0 if it is not set by the user code; unfortunately, my code can't handle a lateral direction of 0 in some spots (it is always supposed to be 1 or -1, that was the point of the change in the first place). A result of having the direction variable set to 0 is that my bot doesn't move some of the time. In other words, under certain conditions, Horizon is a sitting duck for two or three enemy shots at the beginning of every round!

<li> MAJOR bugfix: believe it or not, lateral velocity was being calculated incorrectly in the gun.
<li> And another significant bug: int-to-double-and-back-again conversions were messing with the "time since acceleration" attribute, in the movement and gun.
<li> "Stop" is now interpreted as moving in the previous direction, something I've meant to change for a long time.
<li> Firepower is more aggressive.

<li> A major refactoring: the clustering code is now in its own class instead of integrated into the movement and gun code, and should be somewhat faster.
<li> Reverted to surfing only two waves, and ranking later waves much lower as before. However, the danger calculation now uses the minimum of the next wave dangers instead of the average.
<li> The gun's log now goes ten times deeper; hopefully this will do a better job at hitting the 90%-plus of rumble bots without adaptive movements.
<li> The attribute weights have been changed significantly in both the movement and the gun.

<li> Reintroduced a graphical debugging system...

(Back before 0.9.5.1, waves were lined up correctly, but it didn't look like it because of the bug in Robocode's drawing, which made me change my wave handling code to make it *look* like they were lining up...)

<li> Several other minor tweaks to the surfing.

Well, that just goes to show that tweaking really does make a difference. Remember, the only change between 1.0beta6 and 1.0beta7 was to modify a few constants.
