<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

This is mostly a cleaned up version of Autobot3 where I have tried to simplify the approach.  This is really my first robot
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

Well, moderately competitive I guess - ranks about mid 80th overall.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It has 6 different movement patterns that range from zig/zag attack patterns and ramming to dodge strategies. It selects a movement pattern based on the weighted random choice and then adjusts the weights based on a win or loss in the round. 
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

It has a statisical gun and when the stats don't look all that good it uses a linear/circular gun instead.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

One of the movement patterns chooses a new direction and speed every time it sees the enemy fire - however the other movement patterns don't directly dodge bullets.  I have a feeling that because it can change movement strategies during a fight it may screw up some statistical or pattern guns over the course of a battle.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

No melee strategy other than try to fire at the closest target.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

No real melee logic.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

It does save the weighting factors between rounds, but nothing between matches.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

AUTonomous roBOT - but more from the cartoon about Autobots and Decepticons.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

I have not published the code yet since it could still use a lot of cleanup work.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

I would like to get it down to minibot size.  Codesize for Autobot3 was 5500, Autobot4 is now down around 4k, but still a lot of work to do to clean this up.  I will probably have to eliminate some of the less useful movement patterns to get the code size down to mini size.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Since the movement selection is a bit random it can win big or lose big against the same robot.  I guess I will just have to wait to see how it all averages out.  However it seems Fermat kicks my *$$ at this point and on the other hand it dominates Krabby 1.19.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

Snippetbot was the starting point.
