<UL >
<li> v. 0.7 - First beta.  After all I've said about how I was going to make this huge kick-butt bot, and the 2 times I just trashed it and started over, I finally feel I have a releasable beta.  This version includes:
<UL >
<li> Guns derived from the systems on <a href="robowiki@FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, <a href="robowiki@Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a> and <a href="robowiki@Barracuda" class=wikipagelink>Barracuda</a>.
<li> A movement system modified from the original <a href="robowiki@FloodMovement" class=wikipagelink>FloodMovement</a> to help control curve shape more powerfully (See the <a href="robowiki@FloodHT/Hype" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT/Hype</a> page for more on that).
<li> A custom data-saving technique that should allow it to store information on roughly 100 opponenets and stay under its quota
<li> Includes 24 variants of <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>, which could even increase in the future.
<li> Hard for opponents to figure out in the short term (= good for the <a href="robowiki@EternalRumble" class=wikipagelink>EternalRumble</a>), but well equipped for the long term (= good for saving that data).
</UL>
<li> 0.8 - Second beta.  I basically started over in several aspects, so that will make 3 times.  Hopefully this is the last.  A lot was added, and a little was taken away:
<UL >
<li> No more VG's.  Just one gun that works like Novacaine, just give it time, it will knock you out.
<li> Movement modified, uses less 'OCM'.  Hopefully it's better.  also has a melee movement now.
<li> Complete team/melee awareness, using a 'minimum risk' movement.
<li> Redid data saving pretty much.
<li> Better stability, probably because of the lower complexity of the gun.
</UL>
<li> 0.9 - Third beta.  It occurs to me that if 0.8 was the third time I started over on <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a>, 0.9 is at least the 5th.  And 0.8 wasn't the last.  On the bright side, this design is likely to stick around for at least <em>one</em> more version.  This version is incomplete, but certainly closer to something I can call 1.0 than anything before.  Teams is totally not done, and not even as good as 0.8, but it should be very competitive in melee and 1-on-1.
<li> 0.9.1 - For some reason Robocode didn't like the <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> 0.9 jar, so I made a new one - only difference is one word of the description is on the next line now.
<li> 0.9.2 - Robocode 1.0.6 specifically didn't like this version.  Hopefully this is the last such revision here.
