A first year engineering student and relative newbie Robocode. I discovered Robocode in late 2007, and have spent some late nights trying my luck.
<p>
<H4>My released robots</H4>

<UL >
<li> <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> - A team I made for <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a>. Instead of being two advanced targeting/dodging bots as is often the case in <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a>, it focuses on some tactics.
<li> <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> - A <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> bot I'm starting to test a few ideas (perhaps innovative ideas if I'm lucky).
<li> <a href="robowiki@Woodchip" class=wikipagelink>Woodchip</a> - A quick little <a href="robowiki@MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> for fun. Very unoriginal code though (borrows <a href="robowiki@RaikoNano" class=wikipagelink>RaikoNano</a> movement).
<li> <a href="robowiki@Polylunar" class=wikipagelink>Polylunar</a> - A team that extends <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> tactics to the team roborumble. Looking promising right now.
<li> <a href="robowiki@MiniSurreptitious" class=wikipagelink>MiniSurreptitious</a> - My mini melee bot with <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a> and <a href="robowiki@HeadOnTargeting" class=wikipagelink>HeadOnTargeting</a>
</UL>
<p>
<H4>My unreleased bots</H4>

<UL >
<li> <a href="robowiki@Gwynfor" class=wikipagelink>Gwynfor</a> - Well, Gwynfor has changed a fair bit over time, but currently serves at a platform for testing my <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela/NeuralPatternMatching" class=wikipagelink>NeuralPatternMatching</a> idea. Unfortunately it's not going terribly great and is having some troubles in the PatternMatchingChallenge<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=PatternMatchingChallenge" class=wikipageedit>?</a> with acceleration. If I ever get this fixed though Gwynfor will see the rumble.
<li> Mervin - My first moronic attempt at robocoding. It was kind of modular but very sloppy, and consisted of not much more than a circular movement predictor and a hacked up mostly-perpendicular movement pattern. It was good against the sample bots but not much else. Mervin probably won't be released to public ever, unless anyone really wants to see how sloppy my java coding is of course. Mervin just grew too messy, but was fun while it lasted though. Interestingly though, Mervin despite it's faults had some surprisingly effective movement, which some time I may some time document and see if others agree with my analysis of why it might have been working.
</UL>
<p>
<H4>My planned bots</H4>

<UL >
<li> WaveBumper - A surfing Rambot? Surely I wouldn't be so crazy... ;-)
<li> Viande - It's name is french for "meat". It's a bot I'll probably make on the way of developing <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> in the same framework. Essentially it will be a <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> targeting bot, with a surfing-style movement to move in the way the opponent does, using the DC data. Essentially, it'll be a relatively advanced cannibal bot with DC targeting and DC movement cannibalism. I don't intend this bot to a serious competitor and will more be for amusement of having a <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a>-Cannibal, but who knows.
<li> Vert - An idea for a neural network bot using layers of restricted boltzmann machines. I'm doubting it has as much promise as RougeDC but may be interesting to try.
<li> TortoiseTwins - A planned <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> team, experimenting with <a href="robowiki@BulletShielding" class=wikipagelink>BulletShielding</a> in a <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> setting. Often it's been found that having a bot shield itself is not practical, however I speculate that a pair of twins could shield each other with decent reliability. This may be a tricky one to get right but I think should be doable. I don't expect it to succeed in <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> as much as <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>, but will be meant as a proof of concept of <a href="robowiki@BulletShielding" class=wikipagelink>BulletShielding</a> being practical in team situations.

Welcome.  Among the good reasons for releasing your bot periodically to the Rumble is that it's a convenient time to back up your source code.  Sometimes I'll go on a major refactoring campaign or start hacking out pieces that I am frustrated with, only to find out that I was making a big mistake.  It's good to be able to go back and take parts (or start over) from an old bot.  My latest work (which I haven't been releasing but still make periodic backups) has had three prior versions of my bot to use as a reference for how I was doing things, and I've copied code back in from them. -- <a href="robowiki@Martin_Alan_Pedersen" class=wikipagelink>Martin</a>
<p>
Hi. Yeah, periodic backups are good things and I'll probably start using a local SVN server to store revisions at some point, but I haven't gotten to that yet and just want to get Gwynfor to a non-embarrassing state (i.e. doesn't blindly get stuck on walls) before releasing it. Also, I've been avoiding deleting code in favour of keeping old classes for movement patterns and such things around but unused. But anyways, it shouldn't be long before I release Gwynfor into the rumble, as my todo list before that just consists of first some refactoring/cleanup, and then finishing my new 'secret sauce' of movement. Thanks. --<a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Welcome! Glad to see you went ahead and made yourself a page. I know I already said it, but don't worry about the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> uploads - we've all run into such issues and it's not a big deal. We've had bad clients, bad bots, bad server (running out of disk space), and bad versions of Robocode. =) Feel free to post questions, I think this community is a pretty helpful bunch. If you're interested, there are a lot of <a href="robowiki@OpenSource" class=wikipagelink>OpenSource</a> bots on the site, and if you're not, there's plenty of good (codeless) information / discussion. Best of luck with your bots. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Hey Voidious. Thanks. Yeah, I know about the multitude of <a href="robowiki@OpenSource" class=wikipagelink>OpenSource</a> bots out there, but I've been thus far preferring to make my own code (what better way to understand the algorithms, than coding it yourself? :)) but I have indeed been inspired by many discussions/ideas I've seen on the wiki here. I'll probably add some comments to the relevant topics I've been inspired by once Gwynfor is out on the battlefield, once I have a better idea of how my variations/implementations are working. Thanks alot. --<a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
Well, lately I seem to have taken a liking for the battlefield of teams. It's relatively fresh, and as shown by <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> you don't even need learning to compete yet. Lots to be explored really. I may come back to 1v1 eventually, but I refuse to do it without SOME level of originality in either my targeting or movement, and I don't expect that to happen any time soon. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
How about figuring out a new algorithm for <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>? We already have <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/TrueSurf" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/TrueSurf</a> and <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/GoToStyle" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/GoToStyle</a>. I'm sure there are other ways of doing it. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well perhaps, but one thing I've found for sure, is that ideas can't really be forced and sometimes good ones are just stumbled upon. After all, <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>' movement was actually an accident at first, a side effect of an experiment of how to get into position for close-range synchronized orbiting, however it ended up having good results so I sort of "purified" the essence of why it appeared to be working. In terms of ways to do <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>, I would say the broad definition of <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> could be simplified as "Movement that attempts in some manner to move to <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> statistically less likely to be fired at" (essentially the reverse of <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>). While most <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> seems to be focused around perpendicular movement, as that maintains a stable distance, I would say that that it could be applied to all sorts of concepts, such as <a href="robowiki@TrackMovement" class=wikipagelink>TrackMovement</a> for instance. Actually many implementations of <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> I would also call <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a> at the same time, as they certainly fit the line "The idea is to pick a series of points that you could go to next, and rate each one with a 'risk factor', then move to the lowest-risk location." and it's just that the risk factor is primarily based upon how likely it is for the enemy to fire in certain directions. <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/TrueSurf" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/TrueSurf</a> in particular I would call a form of <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a>. Often the only thing about many <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> implementations that differs significantly from "classic" <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a> besides the source of the risk factor, is that the points at which the risk is evaluated are focused around perpendicular movement. The way that <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> implementations often like to keep constant distance, and that <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> works best at constant distance, in my opinion is a weakness of a number of <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> implementations as it gives <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> that doesn't segment distance at easy day, and <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> that does segment distance a quicker time learning. Of course, there's the issue of how to move over a wide enough range of <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a>. One interesting note, is that to move over the very widest range of <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> you shouldn't move perpendicular, instead you should be perpendicular when the wave is fired at you, but don't turn after that, as that will move away slightly increase the time till you are hit and thus increase your escape angle. That's basically how you get the extreme +1 -1 GF movements. Of course, the drawback to this, is this movement causes your distance from the enemy to increase every time you dodge a wave. Now this may be a good tactic if your bot is deciding to adjust it's distance further away, however as the battlefield is not limitless you must keep your distance close enough that you're not constantly having to mess with wallsmoothing. Now, if you don't need those extreme guessfactors, how much you turn away/toward the firing point can result in a decrease to the escape angle. Using this mechanism, instead of accelerating/decelerating to get to different <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a>, one could keep a constant velocity and just turn towards or away from the enemy to control their <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a>. Also, I believe that it may be possible to tune the timing of when the bot using this movement fires, to fire when it "swoops" in closer and thus has a better hit rate and potential for triggering anti-dive mechanisms. Also, this movement could be extended to in some cases "swoop" in even closer to the enemy when they're <a href="robowiki@GunHeat" class=wikipagelink>GunHeat</a> is still high, in hopes of getting a good shot while the risk is low, as well as again possibly triggering anti-dive mechanisms. In some ways this is kind of similar to that "<a href="robowiki@Rednaxela/DiveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>Dive Surfing</a>" idea I was thinking about except it's more defensive. I suppose I'll call this idea "SwoopStyle WaveSurfing" due to how it would have a tendency to "swoop" inwards frequently. Who knows if I'll be able to implement this successfully, but heck it's an idea. Well that was an interesting brainstorm-rant, I started talking about how ideas can't be forced, then in my rambling I came up with a bit of an idea. Wow what a long rant/blob of test, I feel sorry for anyone who goes and reads the whole thing. Well this was amusing :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
It's funny that you should classify <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/TrueSurf" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/TrueSurf</a> as a minimum-risk movement, and <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing/GoToStyle" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/GoToStyle</a> as not as much. I would classify the other way around: In True Surfing you only evaluate points once you have eliminated the majority of them from your evaluation, ie. only the points you would arrive at when going maximum forward, maximum reverse, and (possibly) stop. In Goto Surfing you take a whole bunch of points(it doesn't matter where you get these points from), and feed them through your evaluation method. This evaluation method may involve precise prediction, but the essense is that you don't only evaluate a limited number of points, you evaluate all points, and it doesn't matter where these points come from. I could change the predictPoints() method in <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> to return every single point on the battlefield, and it would still work fine, albeit slowly. It would still find the point with the minimum risk according to evaluation method, and would still go there. A True Surfer would have a tough time knowing where to go if you asked it about a point. A True Surfer evaluates a <em>direction of movement</em> for danger, not a point. Thus I would classify True Surfing not as <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a>, but MinimumRiskOrbit<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MinimumRiskOrbit" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. Movement implies a destination, but with True Surfing it is not about the destination, but about the direction you are moving in.
<p>
About your concept of moving closer or further away to confuse guns, I think this would be very susceptible to segmentation on <a href="robowiki@AdvancingVelocity" class=wikipagelink>AdvancingVelocity</a>, or even <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a>. It might be very effective against guns without this segmentation, but so is regular surfing =). Currently, I think choosing a 'best distance' is a balance between staying far enough away that you are a small target, and not being limited by the walls. Predicting your movement forward for several waves with different 'best distances' and finding which distance would give you the safest bins would be the best option, but limits on CPU prevent that. Of course if <a href="robowiki@Fnl" class=wikipagelink>Fnl</a> ever does this whole 'average CPU' thing... <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> wouldn't skip turns when I quadruple the number of points ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, I don't think it would be too vulnrable to <a href="robowiki@AdvancingVelocity" class=wikipagelink>AdvancingVelocity</a> and <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> segments, because 1) I thinking it could be implemented as to try to be return to perpendicular at the point in time the enemy fires making it's options wide open (similar to how a squash player returns to the T of the court after hitting), and 2) even if at a given advancing velocity at the time the enemy fires, it should still have quite a wide range of potential <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> particularly considering direction reversals. I think point #1 there does reduce how dramatic the "swooping" motion can be, however I still think could have some merit, particularly in terms of being a little closer when shooting and a little further when being shot at. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Just a couple thoughts from me here. I like the idea of imagining distance as a fluctuating value (like a sine wave) and timing your shots so you're always closer when firing than the enemy is when firing. It seems really hard to implement, but it's a great idea on principle, and even a little difference would help I think. As for actually moving towards / away the enemy frequently in the Swoop idea, I am really skeptical of the value there. You're cutting down on your max escape angle a <em>lot</em> when you do anything too far from perpendicular. You mentioned "going back to perpendicular when they fire", but it seems you're imagining a battle where there's only 1 enemy bullet in the air at a time, when there are usually 2 or 3. You can't really swoop in without affecting the max escape angle of all those other bullets in the air. That's also why moving perpendicular to the abs bearing at fire time isn't practical, despite the fact that it gives the max theoretical escape angles - by the time you're dodging a given bullet, you've already moved quite a bit to dodge the previous ones that were still in the air at fire time. Moving orbitally is a good middle ground that doesn't require many sharp turns.
<p>
Always good to see some fresh and interesting thoughts on <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>. =) I too have long thought of it as a form of <a href="robowiki@MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipagelink>MinimumRiskMovement</a>. I think there's more room for innovation than there might seem at first, even within algorithms that could be classified as <a href="robowiki@TrueSurfing" class=wikipagelink>TrueSurfing</a> or GoToSurfing<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=GoToSurfing" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. They are actually really broad definitions, IMO. I think what happens a lot of times is that the wiki doesn't truly reflect how much innovation and variation there are among bots (like <a href="robowiki@TrueSurfing" class=wikipagelink>TrueSurfing</a> or <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> bots), because the authors get more obsessed with working on their bots than documenting their ideas and brainstorming on the wiki. =)
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Well, "going back to perpendicular when they fire" does fix the issue of being limited by the number of possible escape angles at least as far as one-bullet-at-a-time goes, but yes, it's true that I was primarily just considering when there's one bullet in the air. Of course, to deal with multiple bullets in the air, it could make sense to plot a curving path wich results in a desirable <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a>, and is perpendicular again at all intervals of time at which their <a href="robowiki@GunHeat" class=wikipagelink>GunHeat</a> is expected to be 0. This would be in some ways, a complex variety of "Goto Style" movement, and would only need to be re-evaluated when another bullet is fired. In some ways, when choosing a desirable path of movement, I think the following (ordered) priorities are what should be considered: 1) Getting to a desirable <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a>, 2) Being perpendicular or close to it with enemy <a href="robowiki@GunHeat" class=wikipagelink>GunHeat</a> is zero, 3) Being closer to the enemy when our <a href="robowiki@GunHeat" class=wikipagelink>GunHeat</a> is zero, and 4) Varying various segments about us as to slow enemy learning (i.e. vary distance).  Traditional <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> does very very well at #1 and #2 and it achieves #2 with extreme simplicity, however the constant-distance virtually-always-perpendicular thinking doesn't deal with #3 and #4 ideally in my opinion. I think it would be a superiour movement if you can achive qualities #3 and #4 provided you don't sacrifice at all in terms of #1 and #2. It's true that qualities #3 and #4 can be harder to achieve in significant quantity without sacrificing ability at the more important #1 or #2, when multiple bullets in the air are involved, however, this makes me wonder if it may be interesting to experiment with a closer range surfer of the style I propse, which tries to keep a range where there's only one or occasionaly 2 bullets in the air at a time. I think such a bot wouldn't dominate by as big a margin against weaker bots in the rumble due to the closer range giving simpler targeting an easier time, however I suspect that this tactic might not work bad for a <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/PremierLeague" class=wikipagelink>PremierLeague</a> score. Another thought, is that at sufficently close range, quality #3 outweighs #2 probably. If you're in close range, and time your firing so when they have medium gunheat when you have zero gunheat, you could get to nearly point-blank range when firing and be further away by a significant amount (albit still very very close compared to Traditional <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>'s prefered ranges) when they fire. I think that if you can successfully achieve such tricky distancing, even if you won't dominate weak bots by as big margins, you'll have a notable hit rate advantage aginst strong bots which are unable to counter the distancing techniques. This method could also be potentially be countered by opponants with a less predicable firing rhythm, or by movement that can evade this distancing, however I think that close-range wavesurfing using these distancing methods, could just maybe come out on top of some strong traditional surfers. I suppose you might even be able to abandon the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> part and make a movement purely themed on matching a distancing rhythm to the firing rhythm, however I think it could certainly be combined with <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> too and used as a way to vary one's distance segment to slow learning too. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
One thought I just had, about how to really nicely make a version of WaveSurfing/MinimumRiskMovement<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=WaveSurfing/MinimumRiskMovement" class=wikipageedit>?</a> that accounts for firing rhythm, would be by:
<DL >
<dt><dd> Have a <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> style system that evaluates the danger of different locations, importantly including accounting for botwidth (importantly, using botwidth for the expected distance from the firing point WHEN the wave will pass through you)
<dt><dd> Interact with a <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> gun's targeting code to estimate the probability of hitting the opponent, accounting for botwidth (importantly, using bodwidth for the expected distance of the enemy from your firing point WHEN the wave will pass through them)
<dt><dd> Instead of purely avoiding danger like normal <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>, calculate a risk-benefit ratio
<dt><dd> Instead of calculating for orbital points only, calculate for points moving in close to the enemy, or far from the enemy, too.
</DL>
I think a variation on <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> using this method, of maximizing a risk-benefit ratio, would produce a strong movement that would dodge effectively, move closer when firing and further when being aimed at, and automatically decide a smart distance (Which I suspect would be very very close distance against stronger targeting bots). I think the tricky part, would be predicting the opponent's botwidth in the future, which would probably require future path projecting to do, and thus to do with quality would require either a <a href="robowiki@PatternMatcher" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatcher</a> type method, or keeping statistics on their distancing too alongside their <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a>.
<p>
And the more I think about this idea. the more I feel confident that it would both achieve that movement matched with firing rhythm as well as smart <a href="robowiki@DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> and BulletDodging<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BulletDodging" class=wikipageedit>?</a> all in a statistically sound way. Not only would it be controlling it's <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a>, it will be controlling it's botwidth and it's opponent's botwidth. I think this is definitely the way I'll go if I move back to the 1v1 arena. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

I'm curious, in the <a href="robowiki@DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> page, I see talk about bots learning good distance experimentally over battles, however I wonder, has anyone tried to implement <a href="robowiki@DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> before by estimating hit rates from GuessFactor/WaveSurfing<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=GuessFactor/WaveSurfing" class=wikipageedit>?</a> stats, accounting for the effect of distance on the angular bot width? -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I'm pretty sure <a href="robowiki@Phoenix" class=wikipagelink>Phoenix</a> does some sort of dynamic distance, but I couldn't say what. But doesn't this really just equate to getting as far away as possible? -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Getting as far away as possible is good for your movement, but getting closer is good for your gun (hitrate). The point however is, that movement is much more important for your score than your gun is, so mostly getting far away is better for your score.   -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
@<a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>: If you only take the enemy's predicted hitrate on yourself into account it equates to getting as far away as possible, however, if you <b>also</b> take into account your predicted hitrate against the enemy (data obtained from a <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> gun's stats) while using accurate angular botwidth for both, then I think it would provide distancing which would often not be as-far-as-possible. For example, if you used this with a gun configured to always fire with <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> (but still kept track of <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> gun stats, to predict how likely the <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> is to hit), then this method of <a href="robowiki@DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> would be likely to very quickly learn to move into close range combat in order to narrow the gap between the gun hitrates of each bot.<br>
@<a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>: I suppose, though currently I'm thinking more of from a survivalist perspective, in which the ideal distance is most certainly the distancing which optimizes the ratio of our hitrate to their hitrate. Of course, when your gun is stronger than the enemy gun, the method I propose would choose such very far away distances away naturally, as that would hurt their hitrate more than our hitrate.<br>
-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
The trouble I see with this is that it could work the wrong way. Let's take an example of a bot with strong movement, but weak targeting (eg. linear). It will tell you that there are a lot of very low risk areas to move to, especially in the negative GF range, so increasing your botwidth wouldn't matter much. Your targeting will tell you that if you get closer you will have a much better chance of hitting them. So you move closer, and suddenly they *are* able to hit you with their simple targeting, because you haven't yet learned how their targeting reacts at that distance. It only takes a couple hits for it to be nearly impossible to get that 95% score against linear bots. Staying at a single distance can drastically decrease the learning time of your movement. Rather than finding a 'best distance' from your targeting and movement stats, I think the time would be better invested improving the gun and movement accuracy =). Who knows, perhaps it would be possible, even effective, but the warning bells for a dead-end idea are going off in my head =). For 500 round battles I would definitely consider this, but 35 rounds doesn't give enough time IMO. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, I don't think that's too large a worry, because, even if it gets hit just once ever by a very weak targeting such as linear targeting, which tends to aim at about the same <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> a lot of the time, it's movement would from that point on would strongly avoid getting close enough to get hit again due to a large angular botwidth. <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> shouldn't really be affected by distance anyways, as I'm pretty sure the <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> it would aim at, are just determined by lateral velocity and not distance. If it is a problem though, I could do a variation on the <a href="robowiki@MusashiTrick" class=wikipagelink>MusashiTrick</a> (in spirit anyways), where until it gets hit, it would pretend it's gotten hit by linear, circular, and head on targeting, and dodge any <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> those three would aim at. This would also motivate it to keep a distance just far enough away that it could avoid those three targeting methods. But really, even if it still has troubles getting those 95+ scores against weak bots, I more have my eye on a <a href="robowiki@Survivalist" class=wikipagelink>Survivalist</a> approach and the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/PremierLeague" class=wikipagelink>PremierLeague</a> than plain score ranking. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

<p>
Well, before starting on a more serious 1v1 bot (possibly using some tactics I was thinking of above), I decided to give some thought to <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a>, one of the more successful statistical techniques I've seen used. Firstly, from what I've read on the technique, the predominant form of it is as "K nearest neighbors" that evaluates the kernel density of the nearest neighbors. What I'm thinking now though, is what might be able to produce more precise results than merely nearest neighbors, would be adding a variety of "function detector", that would look at those nearest neighbors and attempt to detect consistent correlations between any segmentations and the <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> of those neighbors. If such a correlation is detected strongly enough in any segment, then the detected "function/correlation" would deal with that segment, and the other segments where a strong correlation is not detected, would be left to kernel density methods. I'm still mulling over exactly how to combine detected "functions" in some segments with with kernel density in other segments, but I think I have a bit of an idea of how to do it.
<p>
What could be used as a "function detector" could vary and I'm not sure what would be best yet. One possibility is just doing a few types of function regression (linear, exponential, etc.) and evaluating if any produce good enough correlations. Another option would be using a neural network, which may work well for taking in the multiple segments, and are often characterized as a type of "non-linear function approximation generator"  and that could simply be evaluated after training on the neighbors to see how strong correlations it found in each segment.
<p>
The reasoning behind this, is that I think this could produce more accurate results when there are fewer really close neighbors to go by. For instance, if this is used in a <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> bot, and the enemy is a <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> enemy, this method very quickly detect, after getting hit fewer times,that the <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> the enemy is firing at are purely a linear function of absolute value of <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> and extrapolate that function. Common variations of <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> would indeed over time learn how where the enemy tends to aim depends on <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a>, however, if the bot has been hit by <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> when it's initial <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> was, for example 8, 6.6, 2 and 7.2, and only has those 4 data points to go on, normal <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> may not predict exactly where the opponent will aim if your <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> becomes 0. This "function detection" extension to the idea however, would very very quickly be able to guess the exact relationship between the <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> and the <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> and be able to make accurate predictions that would hold true even at <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> values it has not seen before. Any thoughts on this idea of extending <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> with "function detection" techniques?
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, after mulling over it a little, I think I've revised/clarified how to accomplish my idea. It would work as follows:
<UL >
<li> Take the k nearest neighbors
<li> Train a neural network with all of the segments as the inputs, and the guess factor as the output
<li> Create kernel density data on the /difference/ between the neural net's predicted guess factor and the real guess factor, for all selected neighbors
<li> Get the guess factor that the neural network outputs for the /current/ segmentation data, and then add the most likely difference from the kernel density data
</UL>
I'm pretty sure, that whenever the neural network finds no significant correlations (in which case the neural network would tend to output the average) this should essentially behave like a normal <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> method, however, when the neural network does find significant correlations (as it would tend to when doing things like predicting the firing of a linear targeting bot) it should give better data I think.
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, for simplicity and speed, I might instead try "Multivariate Linear Regression" which while only capable of mapping linear correlations, I think should provide some useful results. At least as far as learning <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> goes, adding "Multivariate Linear Regression" would enhance <a href="robowiki@DynamicClustering" class=wikipagelink>DynamicClustering</a> just as much as the more complicated neural network. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
An added side effect would be that it automatically adds a sort of dimension weighting...maybe you could use the results of the outputted values of the neural network to adjust the dimension weights on the DC gun? -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, the "function approximation algorithm" (whether it be the neural network, multiple linear regression, or something else) would indeed decide it's own weightings for itself, however while getting some DC dimensioning weights from those would be possible, it would limit it to /only/ putting weight on dimensions which the function approximation finds correlations in, and it's important to note that the function approximation wouldn't detect ALL possible correlations which might turn up in the DC. After all, I want this to be able to fall back on strong traditional DC results whenever the function approximation is failing to find correlations. Therefore, I'd have to use fixed dimension weights or adapt them with some other heuristics (that entropy talk sounds interesting) just like everyone else. Of course, this function approximation enhancement I'm planning to implement could certainly still improve results when there the neighbors are smaller in numbers or further away (which means things like, it should dodge <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting</a> perfectly before taking as many hits as plain DC would need to take to learn it well enough), even if it doesn't help with weighting. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
Hmm, funny. I was testing my <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> calculation code in my latest bot, with my bot sitting still and calculating the <a href="robowiki@GuessFactors" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactors</a> of bullets that hit it. For some reason I was getting these odd discrepencies  when the other bot should have been targeting me at the 0 <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a>. So, I spent a long time debugging. I then switched from <a href="robowiki@Horizon" class=wikipagelink>Horizon</a> to <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> to test it. Turns out nothing was wrong with my code at all, and that all that debugging time was because <a href="robowiki@Horizon" class=wikipagelink>Horizon</a> didn't (couldn't?) target perfect head-on while it moved. In any case, yes, debugging is fun, particularly when you end up spending time only to find your code is working as it should. :)
<br>Edit: Hmm, I think I once saw ABC mention accounting for how your own movement will change the angle when targeting, in other words, account for how rotating the turret happens after firing happens on a tick and not before. I'm guessing this is what Shadow does differently than the others in order to get perfect head-on while moving. It's interesting how Shadow does this yet many other top bots do not and they still do very well. I suppose this small inaccuracy isn't large enough to be a big disadvantage practically.
<br> -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, tonight I managed to hack up enough code to make a very simple surfing for Rouge around the complex components I already built. It uses that precise botwidth, dynamic clustering, but that doesn't by any means mean it works good. Currently it has the following points of being horrible:
<UL >
<li> Currently only considers the next wave to hit it
<li> It only knows 3 movements: perpendicular one way, the other way, and staying still
<li> No distancing whatsoever
<li> It currently only segments on my velocity and nothing else
<li> No wall avoidance at all (it happily choses directions which it's precise prediction know are running into walls)
<li> And for SOME reason there's some really annoying bug that's hiding from me, that is causing it to only dodge at the VERY last moment before the wave hits, sometimes too late. For some reason it's thinking 0 danger to all options until the wave gets very close, and I don't think I have any code that depends on the distance of the wave...
<li> A bunch of other bugs
</UL>
So all those factors make it REALLY horrible. On the other hand, it can outlive some of the weaker nanobots without even firing, by cheekily dodging their poor targeting at the last moment. Actually I'm surprised how long it can live against <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> despite being so horrible. It's actually kind of amusing how many near misses <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> has against it though, which I suppose indicates it's able to at least learn something of how Shadow targets it, even if it's movement is one of the worst I've seen. I really really hope I can figure out why the heck it's dodging so late...
-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, I just made it account for multiple waves, weight all of it based on a formula of 1/t where t is the time till the hit, and fixed a bug that caused it to be indecisive about what direction to move. This seems to have made it work significantly nicer. Even so it still has many deficiencies noted above. On the other hand, I just saw it get very lucky and and survive a lucky round against Shadow without firing a single bullet. It also seems I'm able to survive 100% of the rounds against <a href="robowiki@RaikoNano" class=wikipagelink>RaikoNano</a> without firing a shot, and also win in score despite having no ramming or bullet scores. I suppose it is surfing decently now. Now I just have to fix other bugs, and then add more features (distancing, avoiding walls, and some other stuff) to make it somewhat decent. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
How about releasing a preliminary version with a standard gun, like Raiko's? Often releasing to the rumble can help you identify more bugs by seeing who your problem bots are. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Perhaps in a bit, however I first want to get at least a few of the deficiencies fixed. Just now I fixed one bug that was making it's "perpendicular" positioning be rather wobbly. When I did that though, it's performance against <a href="robowiki@RaikoNano" class=wikipagelink>RaikoNano</a> became far far worse and started losing every round, yet it's performance against Shadow increased a bit. I suppose that fix created nicer movement in some ways but got rid of a wobble that caused <a href="robowiki@RaikoNano" class=wikipagelink>RaikoNano</a> problems. Anyways, I at very least want to get distancing and some form of wall avoidance in before making a preliminary release as such, and probably add a little more segmentation. Thanks for the tip in any case. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
If you like I can run a couple seasons on the movement challenges (I still have access to the distributed setup here at tech). --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Thanks for the offer, though it's not quite ready for that yet I think. First I hope to at least get some <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> set up, and possibly some more proper distancing (currently it doesn't really distance, and just factors "prefer to be far away" and "perfer not to hit walls" into the dangers). In other news, I threw the Raiko gun onto it and tried a few bots around the place. I'm yet to beat any top bots using my movement and the Raiko gun, however in one trial it was giving <a href="robowiki@WaveSerpent" class=wikipagelink>WaveSerpent</a> a very tough match, scoring 43% over 35 rounds, but up until about halfway it was about a 50:50 split. In order to get this far, I since added a "tolerance" factor to make it dodge by larger margins (before it was too precise and imprecision in the opponants was messing with it), made it assume waves are targeting head-on until it gets hit, and I replaced perpendicular/advancing movement, with kinda <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a>-like horizontal-vertical movement. The reason I did the horizonal-vertical movement, is that easily gets around the issue that it was getting stuck in corners before with perpendicular. Once I add <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> I may go back to some kind of  more perpendicular movement though. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, it's looking like that good result against <a href="robowiki@WaveSerpent" class=wikipagelink>WaveSerpent</a> was mostly luck, but in any case I think I've made some improvements. Currently the movement is only segmented on <a href="robowiki@LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> with a weak segmentation on total time (including time from previous rounds) to bias lightly towards new data. I got <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> working using a slightly modified version of Voidious's example on the <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> page and it seems to be working. Just in case anyone is curious, or if you run the movement challenge on it Chase-san, here's [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~agschult/ags.rougedc.RougeDC_Alpha1.jar">[the current state of it]</a>]. Unfortunately, while it accurately surfs simple things well so far as I can tell, it apparently is somewhat predictable to more adaptive targeting. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I know that with my DC-surfing attempts I weighted scans by the inverse of their distance to the current scan. This was a huge improvement. Also, I built these inverse weighted scans to a set of VCS bins, using a similar algorithm to what <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> uses for <a href="robowiki@BinSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>BinSmoothing</a>. All this was courtesy of <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>, BTW, who shared this info of what he did on <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>-- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Yes, I haven't heard of how people are doing that but, I imagine doing that would certainly help. I have a similar but more elaborate idea I plan to try with some interpolation some time. In particular, using function approximation (i.e. multiple linear regression) and and making a "fake" scan that is where the function approximation guesses it would be, and weight that fake scan by how closely the function approximation matches the real scans. I then use the normal scans and weight them by how much they deviate from the function approximation divided by their distance from the current scan. The advantage of this I think, is that if there's a very well-fitting correlation in the scans, this will only dodge the /exactly/ the point the enemy would aim at given those scans (i.e. a linear targeting enemy would show a strong correlation on lateral velocity). If there is less of a correlation, it would dodge the real scans more because it has nothing better to go on. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, I had a stupid bug where it didn't properly account for how one part of the bot shadows other parts of the bot, during precise wave hit prediction. That caused some parts of the bot's surface to be weighted excessively in the danger calculations. I just fixed that now and it's performing far better. I also fixed a major inefficency and now it's running nearly 10x faster (still not a terribly fast bot though). Now that those issues are resolved, I guess I'll get to that weighting of the scans :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm, I tried the weighting you suggested, and it reduced my score against <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfingChallengeBotB" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfingChallengeBotB</a> from 78.252  to 73.382, so I'm not sure weighting by distance as such is too effective. I'm curious, about how many nearest neighbors are you looking for when doing DC-surfing? For the aforementioned results I've been using 10 nearest neighbors. I just changed it to 100 though now and it appears to be getting somewhat better results but the 500 rounds aren't quite finished yet so I'm not sure. After this I'll probably try 100 points again, without your weighting, and see how that works to compare. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, hmm, I can't seem to break 80 points against <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfingChallengeBotB" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfingChallengeBotB</a>... Perhaps whatever is going wrong is not related to weighting at all... perhaps it's that silly wall issue. I'm not sure if that would fully account for it though. I wonder how well some of the high up bots in that challenge would score if they set their preferred distance to be as far away as possible... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm, well here's how I do against <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfingChallengeBotB" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfingChallengeBotB</a> in a few different configurations of weighting and number of neighbors to find (note, in 1/d, d is the elucidian distance between situations):
<TABLE CELLSPACING='0' CELLPADDING='1' BORDER='1'>
<TR VALIGN='CENTER' ><td colspan='0.5'> </td><td colspan="0.5"> 10 neighbors </td><td colspan="0.5"> 50 neighbors </td><td colspan="0.5"> 100 neighbors </td><td colspan="0.5"></td></TR>
<TR VALIGN='CENTER' ><td colspan='0.5'> No weighting </td><td colspan="0.5"> 78.252 </td><td colspan="0.5"> 78.120 </td><td colspan="0.5"> 79.554 </td><td colspan="0.5"></td></TR>

</TABLE>
So it seems the weighting doesn't make a significant difference here. Against a version of bot B, that is modified to not fire if it predicts out of map bounds, and I score 98.200. A similarly modified version which plain ignores map bounds, I score a little lower but similar against. So, I think that really, my biggest problem is that I either need to avoid sticking so close to walls, segment against them, or better yet, both. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm, I was trying it out with the Reiko gun against some of MC2K7, though unfortunately I can't do the full thing as the link to download the modified bots is broken. I seem to get scores about the same as <a href="robowiki@Firebird" class=wikipagelink>Firebird</a> against <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> and <a href="robowiki@Ascendant" class=wikipagelink>Ascendant</a>, however I seem to get a far worse performance against <a href="robowiki@Chalk" class=wikipagelink>Chalk</a>. My score against <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a> also seems respectable compared to other bots in that challenge. I can't try the other parts of the challenge yet as they involve modified bots I don't have avaliable, and nor did I try many seasons for the bots I did test with, however things are looking fairly promising. Against an unmodified <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> I score about 99.2% or so, which isn't too great compared to what ones in the challenge score, but perhaps the modified <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> being less conservative with it's energy would improve the result a little. Here's another [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~agschult/ags.rougedc.RougeDC_Alpha1.jar">[snapshot]</a>] of it for archival purposes. One change I did in addition to what was talked about before, was I made it also use BulletHitBullet<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BulletHitBullet" class=wikipageedit>?</a> events to get an idea of the enemy's aiming. I'm thinking I may switch to perpendicular movement and add some distancing... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

In other words, not so great really, and some of my earlier data was based on some lucky trials for some part. I'm pretty sure my biggest issues are because <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> doesn't have a proper concept of distancing and is always up against a wall which makes it considerably more predictable and also makes the enemy targeting less predictable to it (i.e. linear targeting that accounts for walls).  I'll make some changes to it's movement choices (perpendicular based, as opposed to it's current horizontal/vertical scheme) and try to integrate some kind of distancing. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm, well my first attempt at making the movement perpendicular didn't work out so well. I think I'm going to revret back and try to add distancing to my old movement instead.

Unless you add some sort of distancing I think a Tron-style vertical/horizontal movement will be superior. Keeping your distance is VERY important. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Yeah, and it seems to help Tronish movement too to distance. I reverted to Tron-ish surfing, and then added a light distancing danger that prefers 600, and increased the wallsmoothing factor. The results is kind of interesting. There is a consistent increase in score against the advanced targeters with the exception of Waylander and including <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> (for purposes of this discussion, the way it accounts for wall interaction counts as advanced), and a notable decrease against all else. I think the problem that's happening here, which I confirmed by watching it battle <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a>, is that now it's frequently diving into the enemy when dodging bullets. While it no longer has the old high level of wall interaction and prefers a distance of about 600, it is tending to dive as close as 120 distance due to how the danger of individual waves overrides all else. I'm thinking I might need to switch distancing strategies, to throw out movement options which as too far from the desired distance. I'm also thinking it might be interesting to give it both Tron-ish and perpendicular movement as simultaneous options to evaluate. It shouldn't hurt so long as I fix distancing to throw out the worst movement options for distancing completely.

<strong>Update:</strong> Well, I just gave it a test with this distancing but without the wallsmoothing change, and performance decreased notably. It appears my wallsmoothing change was what caused those improvements, not distancing. Anyways, it's still true that the main issue with this distancing is that it keeps diving to short distances. So in any case I'm going to try setting up distancing that's stricter about not using movement options that are particularly bad for distancing, and possibly using perpendicular options at the same time
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, both to clean up things, and to prepare for simultaneously supporting "tronish" and perpendicular movement, I refactored some things. Now I think it's in the same state as <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> Alpha2 except without the behavior of running away when there are no waves (note it's lowish score against GR3), and cleaner more flexit to pass up better options that it might have saw if it started by first moving in the other direction, but really I don't think that's too big an issue. Also, I really think that applying the "Voidious-style surfing of multiple waves" method of letting True Surfing recursively evaluate options of changing it's path when one wave passes (or in the case of this discussion, a virtual gunheat wave is fired), could really mitigate this disadvantage. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

In my next update I'll have added perpendicular movement and added stricter less dive prone distancing than I tried before.
<br>-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
By the way Skilgannon, I just realized that my surfing code actually lends very very well to your idea of "Tracking the enemy gunheat throughout the prediction, and firing off 'virtual' waves for when their gunheat is zero. These waves can then also be surfed, and factored into the danger for a direction.", so that will probably the next think I implement after I add perpendicular movement and get distancing working decently. I'm particularly thinking this will be interesting for cases when there are no real waves in the air and may make it possible to dodge a little better better in close range due to getting pre-accelerating to what would be needed to dodge. Come to think of it, this could work really well probably if I took a page out of Voidious's book and give it the option of chosing a different direction after the wave is fired (based on the technique that Voidious uses to surf two waves). Hmm, this could also allow a bot to take advantage of the 1 tick delay in the other bot's scan data, by starting to dodge 1 ticks BEFORE they fire, which is 2 ticks before most surfers would detect the bullet... This could allow it to dodge with similar safety at up to 22 units closer to the enemy, as this would basically give two extra ticks to dodge in... One thought though, is it would probably be necessary to keep track of if the particular enemy does indeed actually fire as soon as it's gunheat is 0. Hmm, for this to be accurate though, you would probably need to keep segmented stats on what firepower the enemy uses, probably segmented on distance, hit rate, their energy, and your energy. Just some thoughts on that gunheat idea of yours and how to expand on it...-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
The thing is, I don't think True Surfing lends itself to this idea very well, because you may need to change direction, and the 'firing off virtual waves' depends on segmentation data that could be incorrect if your movement decides, say in 3 ticks, to try going in the other direction. If I ever find the time I'll implement this in my Goto Surfing, and I think it would be more accurate than True Surfing due to being able to predict with 100% accuracy what the enemy will be seeing, and thus getting the attributes/segmentation correct. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, one thought, is you could actually fire off such 'virtual waves' in your main loop instead of in precise prediction, 2 ticks ahead of when you would detect the energy drop, and since at that point you know the scandata the enemy would see, it could be done unambiguously. This may not have as much potential benefit as doing it during precise prediction also, but even so, could be applied to ANY movement which reacts to enemy firing to gain 2 ticks of dodging time, which I think could be significant. Secondly, while True Surfing does change it's mind and thus wouldn't know the segments they see as accurately, it only changes it's mind when it sees a "better" option. Now, sure, this may cause it to pass up better options that it might have saw if it started by first moving in the other direction, but really I don't think that's too big an issue. Also, I really think that applying the "Voidious-style surfing of multiple waves" method of letting True Surfing recursively evaluate options of changing it's path when one wave passes (or in the case of this discussion, a virtual gunheat wave is fired), could really mitigate this disadvantage. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

</TABLE>
In Alpha6, I'm still just using tron-ish movement, and added distancing with a policy of "if the distance from the enemy is more than 50 from the preferred distance, discard movement options which lead further from the preferred distance", with a preferred distance of 425 for now. In effect, this meant that most of the time, the only 2 "Tronish" movements are available plus a stop movement. This seemed to lead a performance drop across the boards, except against <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a>, <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> and <a href="robowiki@Chalk" class=wikipagelink>Chalk</a>. Particularly distressing is the decrease in performance against <a href="robowiki@RaikoMicro" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMicro</a> score and <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> score. So, to sum up some of what I think I've discovered:
<UL >
<li> Tronish-surfing with a preference to run away doesn't work too bad
<li> Tronish-surfing with no distancing at all doesn't work too bad either
<li> Tronish-surfing with light distancing dangers added to options, causes diving into opponents which is bad
<li> Tronish-surfing with "strict" distancing, leaves too few movement options to surf too great
</UL>
I plan to add perpendicular options now to see how that works out. Either way though, one thing concerning me are my less than stellar scores against <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> even before with the 98.39. When I observe it battle I notice that sometimes it on rare occasion seems to get stuck and then hit. At first I suspected my precise prediction wasn't detecting me getting hit when it should have detected it, however when I looked at the danger logs of movement options, it knew ahead of time that it was going to get hit for sure, so it was clearly predicting the hit. I'm not really sure what's going on and suggestions are welcome, but I'm currently suspecting my <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> may breaking things and I'll add some debugging graphics to help diagnose that.
<br>-- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm, I have a bit of question about distancing when surfing if anyone with some experience might be able to answer. Well, while there is much information around about how to surf waves and such, and I seem to have the basics of predicting the danger of movements down pretty solid, there seems to be very little information around on distancing and I can't for the life of me figure out how to make a half-decent distancing mechanism. The only explation I've seen of how people do it, was Voidious mentioning that he uses a method of modifying the angles of perpendicular movement to dive towards the enemy or move further back. What I wonder about that though, is what is that distancing is relative to? You could use the distance to the origin of the nearest wave, however that would not be an accurate reflection of current distance to the opponant. Alternatively, you could use the current distance to the opponant, however it's future values are unknown and thus it would throw off precise prediction quite notably possibly. So my question is... how the heck to people get around those issues when distancing? :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, I just took a look at the code of <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> and <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>. I couldn't find the distancing code in CC for some reason, but I quickly found it in Dookious. It seems Dookious does the first option of what I said: distance relative to the origin of the wave it's surfing. So I suppose that wouldn't be too big of an issue I guess then. My question is still open though if anyone has any comment: Anyone do it differently? -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
checking the (inscrutable) movement code... Garm moves perpendicular to the line from the origin to its position (at the tick when the bullet was fired). If there are two bullets it surfs perpendicular to the average of them. I have no explicit distancing, but generally Garm moves slightly away from the enemy with this method. The intention of this is to reach the maximum possible escapeangle. In comparison to the normal way of surfing Garm moves in straight lines around the enemy while the traditional Surfer moves in curves. If there is no wave at all it tries to get at its preferred distance of 450. --<a href="robowiki@Krabb" class=wikipagelink>Krabb</a>
<p>
IIRC, Shadow orbits the closest wave's origin. It moves slightly closer/away from that origin if the distance is out of a 200px "safe zone". -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<p>
Take a look in Cunobelin, the distancing is a very simple formula that I think is very effective, it is virtually the same as in <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> and Waylander. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Thanks for the tips everyone! Anyways, I made another version, which orbits oldest moving wave and distances relative to that (I know the wave to first hit me is better, I'll deal with that later), and started distancing by a method of smoothly adjusting the attack/retreat angle based on my distance from the desired distance, but never deviating more than 45 degrees from perpendicular (unless wallsmoothing does it). When there's no wave, just use plain advancing/retreating movement to get to the desired distance, and using a desired distance of 400 for now. Here's the results:

I wonder if it's necessary to do as <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> and <a href="robowiki@X2" class=wikipagelink>X2</a> do, with giving the precise prediction the option of changing direction after the first wave has passed, or if there is some bug causing many of the times <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> is hitting me... I wonder if I'm begining to understand <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a>... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I don't think you need the multiple waves at all to do better against <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> - try <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> against HOF and see how she fares, which I think is pretty well. She only surfs the closest wave. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
The thing about HOF is that it doesn't always shoot completely Head On. HOF doesn't have set<a href="robowiki@AdjustGunForRobotTurn" class=wikipagelink>AdjustGunForRobotTurn</a>(true);, so if it is turning the body of the robot while it fires it will be quite a bit off. I suggest you make the <a href="robowiki@BinSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>BinSmoothing</a> on your surfing algorithm smooth wider, so that your bot keeps away from the center better. Also, you mentioned something about random freezing - this is the surest thing to reduce your scores in challenges, and unless you get rid of this completely that last percent or 2 is going to be impossible to get. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, actually <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> is about only bot I've seen actually be capable of doing absolute perfect head-on when moving (even other top bots don't seem to consider the delay between turning the gun and firing). In any case, I already pretend the range of guessfactors hitting me is 0.09 wider than the actual from my ultraprecise botwidth, in order to account for inaccuracy as you're noting Skilgannon, and I think 0.09  should be more than enough for that. Also, I'm 95% sure that random freezing was fixed many versions ago back when I fixed a very major inefficiency (now I spend about 1/30 of the available time processing my surfing, as opposed to over 1/2 before). One thing I am noticing though from new debugging graphics... is that on very very rare occasion, the wall smoothing is getting the direction to smooth in wrong and very occasionally it seems to get hit then due to that restricting movement options, and also, for some reason, on very very rare occasion, I'm not detecting the waves of very small/fast bullets fired just as they die... Those two events are extremely rare, but I wonder if those could be the primary problems...  -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> Several versions back in <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> I started firing waves from the enemy at the minimum of their energy and last known bullet power, as they died, if their gunheat was zero. It didn't make any difference. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<li> Hmm, interesting. So I assume the issue is that you don't get enemy scan events as they die? So I guess that apparently these rare times they fire as they die, are not enough of an issue to worry about? -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
</UL>
<p>
0.09 is not enough - if you have debugging graphics to see where GF0 is and watch about 10 battles between you and HOF you'll see a few bullets that are at about GF +-0.3. My latest versions of <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> score higher than the earlier incarnations, particularly against HOF, because they have the option of keeping moving at full speed to get out of tricky situations. My <a href="robowiki@BinSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>BinSmoothing</a> weights any position as the sum of the inverse GF distances squared from all the shots in that segment. So the further away the less dangerous it is (the same idea as in <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> - take a look at the code for the <a href="robowiki@BinSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>BinSmoothing</a>, it works very well). This effectively pushes my bots right to the edge of GF 1 against Head On bots, keeping them far away from wobbly guns. This could also improve your scores against Splinter and <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Hmm... you're right... I ran 66 rounds againt HOF, and the lowest GF I detected it aim at was -0.4553 and the highest was 0.2444. Note, those are not what my bot got hit at necessarily, as most of my targeting data against HOF is from BulletHitBullet<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BulletHitBullet" class=wikipageedit>?</a> events rather than bullets hitting me, but indeed this shows where HOF is aiming. So yes, this does certainly seem to be a factor that I will have to deal with. Note "binsmoothing" exactly literally doesn't apply as I don't have bins with my use of DC, but indeed equilivant smoothing should be put on the data samples. So yes, this does need fixing, I'm not sure this is the biggest factor though, because the majority off the hits I do actually take are still within GF +-0.09, and in fact within GF +-0.03... so there's something else at play... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I would check that you're actually moving where your precise prediction thinks you are. Make sure you're rotating around the wave you're surfing, wallsmoothing using the same limits, going in the same direction, that sort of thing. This is the primary reason I chose Goto Surfing, because once I get the simulation correct I just say goto(point); and all the rest of the work is done for me =). Welcome to <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a> =) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, to simplify that, I made a "RobotDriver<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RobotDriver" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" interface, which, for a given robot state wave list state will always output the same results, and also a "VirtualRobot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=VirtualRobot" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" interface that it runs on, and I have implementations for my status, the enemy status, and then I have a "VirtualRobotPredictor<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=VirtualRobotPredictor" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" abstract class that implements "VirtualRobot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=VirtualRobot" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" and handles perfect robocode physics, and then I have "SurfingPredictor<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=SurfingPredictor" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" that's a subclass for that, which controls the VirtualRobotPredictor<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=VirtualRobotPredictor" class=wikipageedit>?</a> based on a RobotDriver<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RobotDriver" class=wikipageedit>?</a> that I give it, and it gets the danger of using that RobotDriver<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RobotDriver" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. In any case, I do have a nice architecture in place to promote code reuse and ensure exactly the same code is steering both the predictor and the real robot. That said, that there could still be holes in it of course. Anyways, I know my wall smoothing is sometimes using the wrong orientation (i.e. clockwise counterclockwise), and that should be fixed regardless of if it's the main cause. Also, I'm not sure exactly the circumstances but sometimes I'm not detecting waves of the opponant they fire at the same tick as they die... Welcome to <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a> indeed... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I think you fire bullets with a power less than 0.1 if your energy is below 0.1. And you probably have a conditional like energydifference=&gt;0.1D somewhere in your detection code. But I'm not sure :)--<a href="robowiki@Krabb" class=wikipagelink>Krabb</a>
<p>
Nope, I use energydifference =&gt; 0.01 instead. Reason being, in the code of Robocode itself, it counts a robot with less than 0.01 energy as dead :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
HAH! I fixed the wall smoothing to use the right orientation, and now I had a big performance increase!

Hahaha! I also appear to have made a record score of how well anyone has done against <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a> in MC2K7! So, things still aren't perfect, but fixing that bug was a big help! Finally this score is becoming somewhat respectable. So... now need to figure out where I'm still losing points to HOF. I'm thinking I'm going to try smoothing to keep further from danger like <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a> is saying... It's a little more complicated to make smoothing as such work with the way I'm using precise per-tick botwidth and DC, as opposed to single botwith and bins, however I think I know how to do it. -- [Rednaxela]
<p>
Well, I implemented the suggestion <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a> had to make it try to get as far as it could from the danger points. Not really an overall improvement though. So... now that I've broken the 99.0 barrier against HOF, I need to figure out what is preventing me from getitng past the 99.5 mark...

Hmm, to figure out what's happening now, I decided to watch more HOF battles in real time.... after what seemed like half an hour of watching <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> not getting hit at all, it finally got hit. The circumstances of getting hit, were that wallsmoothing had caused it to dive in too close to HOF. So, I suppose some kind of <a href="robowiki@DiveProtection" class=wikipagelink>DiveProtection</a> is what I need next in a quest for perfection against HOF? :)<br>
<strong>Update:</strong> Huh... or not... I was running my earlier manually run tests using HOF 0.1, however when I switched to HOF OS MC2K7 like <a href="robowiki@RoboResearch" class=wikipagelink>RoboResearch</a> was using... It suddenly became prone to not continuing forward after it thought it dodged the wave... so I guess I need to figure out what the heck is happening differently with the MC2K7 version of HOF that could cause this... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Heh, well, made some slight changes to how it "smooths" the hit data in 9a.... Then in 9c I made further away waves weighted exponentially less as opposed to linearly less...

Haha!

Unlike what <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a> was thinking, I don't fire these virtual waves in the precise prediction, however I fire them in the main loop 2 ticks before I'd see the energy drop. In order to support this, I also made a KDTree keep track of stats of enemy firing power, segmented on my energy, their energy, and distance. So what's the result?

It appears that these virtual gunheat waves gave me the ability to surf safely notably closer than otherwise! I think what's happening, was that my biggest area of point loss against HOF was when I dived towards it due to lack of dive protection, however these gunheat waves made the diving considerably less dangerous because two extra ticks means a lot at close range :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Hmm... well... I've felt pretty good today with how I've gotten close to the 99.5 mark on HOF and have a record score against GR3, however... now I'm getting frusturated again and it's feeling like <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a> some more... It's being difficult to figure out what's causing these last few hits of HOF on me due to how rare they are. I wish it were possible to save the replays that Robocode can do, and then replay specific moments when my bot was hit. Actually.... perhaps I should go to all the massive trouble of making my own bot construct custom replays exported as an animated gif file... but that's a pain because I'd need to store a lot of history for that to work... bah stupid <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a>... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Wow, it seemed that firing the waves 2 ticks earlier really helped, especially against the close-distance fighters. I'll have to give that a try =). How about simply recording, when you get hit against HOF in ticks from the beginning of the round, where you are, where he is, where the wave was fired from, what GF you were hit on (or the minimum and maximum GF of your bot on the wave), what the bullet power is, what the distance you are from the wave center (this can be calculated afterwards, I guess), that kind of stuff. Then look for trends in the data, rather than watching all 50 rounds. Oh, another usefull one might be what the danger at the point you are at is, or perhaps an entire 'range' of dangers on the wave at different GFs. But before you draw too many conclusions, another 35 seasons wouldn't go amiss :-). I've seen bigger deviations than that after 15 seasons, although this does seem fairly across the board improvement. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well, more seasons would indeed be good, but I tend to be fairly impatient. Even when running two battles at once taking advantage of my duel core processor, it still takes an hour to run 15 seasons. I suppose I will run a longer trial some time though. As far as debugging, one neat thing I added, was a code snippet that takes a "screenshot" of my debugging graphics whenever I get hit (if anyone wants I could paste the code snippet somewhere), making a different graphics context passing to my onPaint() and saving the image in my robot's data directory. So far I'm still not sure what's going wrong, though some things look a little wonky. I think I'll need to add more information to these graphics in any case, but I am really liking this debugging method of automatically taking snapshots of my debugging graphics whenever I'm hit :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

<li> Hah, that's a pretty neat way of doing it.

If I ever find the time to rewrite <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> I expect to go through a lot of that again =). As far as <a href="robowiki@DiveProtection" class=wikipagelink>DiveProtection</a>, what both <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> and Dookious do are make closer points more dangerous. I remember it took a lot of tuning to get <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> to stay far enough from HOF not to get trapped between bullets, and when to dodge through the dangerous area to get away from the walls. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<li> Well, here's my quick hackish code I made to make the little debugging "screenshots". Just put it in the main bot class, make sure your onPaint is set up to show whatever debugging graphics is necessary, and then call writeImage() wherever you detect being hit (or any other time you want a "screenshot"). As far as <a href="robowiki@DiveProtection" class=wikipagelink>DiveProtection</a>, I've found that the "early warning" gun heat waves make it considerably less necessary :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

Wow.... all this time I had a really stupid bug where I would often match the wrong bullet to the wrong wave, when they were of the same power, and the one I was matching was not the oldest wave (happened a lot when my bullets hit their bullets). I'm <strong>very</strong> surprised I did as well as I did with that error there, because not only would that cause me to get hit sometimes when getting rid of a wave too early, but it also intefered with my data on the enemy targeting. Anyways... that really dumb bug is now fixed I think... I guess I'll run some seasons, maybe a few more seasons this time if I have the patience. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
So you're now matching on distance traveled as well as bullet power? -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Before I <strong>thought</strong> I was matching on source bot name, bullet power, and distance traveled. Turns out "distance traveled" was completely broken though... I think I have it fixed now. -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, since that bugfix, I now seem to have a HOF score I can be rather proud of, even if it's not quite up to Dookious's 99.90+ score.

So now that HOF is basically conqured and I trash GR3 better than anyone else does, I wonder what to work on next... will it be SPL, GRG, WAY, RKM, or the advanced trio... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
What about releasing a version with Raiko's gun to the rumble? I think you got the worst bugs out now...and I want to see how it does =) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Well... there's one bug that's really bugging me that I want to fix before considering a preliminary rlease to <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>. In particular, it still freezes very very occasionally. Unfortunately this is so ridiculiously rare that I haven't been able to pin down when it's happening (i.e. 1 in 1000 rounds or so). If anyone has any suggestions to figure out where this bug is, that would be welcome. I wish that Robocode had an option of pausing the battle as soon as a robot freezes, giving me a chance to figure it out in a debugger... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Do you know if it's stopping from timeouts or exceptions? Some of the trig functions can throw exceptions in rare circumstances, for example Math.tan(PI/2) and so on, if you take the result and pass it to something else. If it's timeouts look for loops that could possibly not terminate in time due to special circumstances, wallsmoothing comes to mind. But release it anyways! When you find the bug you can see how much of a difference it actually makes. -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
It's a timeout that's happening, but I'm not sure what loops I have which could be doing that... Anyways, yeah... fine, it's in the rumble now. I'll keep versioning in "Alpha" while using the Raiko gun, change to "Beta" when I have my own gun, and then toss the prefix once both movement and gun are something that mildly satisfy me :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Um....this might be a bit premature, but welcome to The2000Club ;-) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
It's looking like it'll make it... but... I won't consider it entry to The2000Club until I do it with my own gun :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well it's doing alright... now I wonder what it's weaknesses are that are most in need of improvement...
<UL >
<li> The gun? Raiko's gun is pretty good but nothing like that of the top bots
<li> My stat handling?
<UL >
<li> Segmentation choices/weightings? Currently I only segment by lateral velocity, angular velocity, and time (only a weak weighting on time, just enough to make it prefer new data over old), and surely I could do a lot better...
<li> Multiple segmentation options? It seems a lot of top bots use something like <a href="robowiki@CrowdTargeting" class=wikipagelink>CrowdTargeting</a> in terms of keeping stats on multiple combinations of segmentations and overlaying the data, perhaps I should try similar
<li> My choice of 50 nearest neighbors to search for? Perhaps a different number would be better?
</UL>
<li> My surfing options? While I do consider all waves, I don't give the surfing the option to change direction during the precise prediction like <a href="robowiki@X2" class=wikipagelink>X2</a>, <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> and possibly others do
</UL>
Not sure what I'm most in need of, but those are ideas that come to mind.... I'm not sure what to work on first... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, or instead I could:
<UL >
<li> Make a poetry generator that makes <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> write poety about the other bot after the battle... perhaps even integrated with some stats to make the poetry tailored to characteristics of the other bot
<li> Begin TheTeam2000Club<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TheTeam2000Club" class=wikipageedit>?</a>... ;-)
</UL>
Those might be a nice break from <a href="robowiki@WaveSuffering" class=wikipagelink>WaveSuffering</a>.... -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, I took a look at <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a>'s details in the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>, and it confirmed regardless of gun, I'm <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a>'s worst enemy. Some of <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a>'s high level bots come close, but nobody in the whole rumble can beat <a href="robowiki@GrubbmThree" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmThree</a> better than I am :)

In some cases I'm getting about 80% against rambots where nobody else can get past 75% or even much past 70%! It looks like I've created the best ever surfing aginast <a href="robowiki@RamBots" class=wikipagelink>RamBots</a> and I'm not even using <a href="robowiki@DiveProtection" class=wikipagelink>DiveProtection</a> that some people seem to think is so important :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
Well, <a href="robowiki@RamRod" class=wikipagelink>RamRod</a> seems to be an exception... it's the one <a href="robowiki@RamBot" class=wikipagelink>RamBot</a> I'm not trashing better than everyone else. All signs seem to be that <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> does very well against things with basic targeting, however for the most part I horribly fail against anything with even simple segmented GF targeting. Oddly, I have some weird exceptions like trashing <a href="robowiki@Firebird" class=wikipagelink>Firebird</a> or <a href="robowiki@GrypRepetyf" class=wikipagelink>GrypRepetyf</a>, but for the most part, if the enemy targeting is decently adaptive my movement sucks. I'm suspecting that my stat handling and lack of flattener is really my problem... I am happy though that I seem to be the king of <a href="robowiki@RamBot" class=wikipagelink>RamBot</a> trashing with the sole exception of <a href="robowiki@RamRod" class=wikipagelink>RamRod</a> :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
How about having your nearest neighbors number vary depending on the size of your log. Giving the surfing the option to change direction definitely can't hurt. Also adding distance as a attribute to your surfing stats, and maybe (time-since-direction-change)/(bullet-flight-time), limited at 1.5. Of course, a poetry generator to rival <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a>'s insulter would be fun =). 
<p>
I'm guessing its those extra 2 ticks that give you such nice scores against <a href="robowiki@RamBots" class=wikipagelink>RamBots</a> - I gotta give that a try. <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> 1.1.0 will be here soon to challenge your <a href="robowiki@RamBot" class=wikipagelink>RamBot</a> supremacy! =). I need something like this to give me a few more points between me and <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, I'm worried that <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a> will come back with a tweak and reclaim the crown! =) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<UL >
<li> Here's a little trick I found that helps against <a href="robowiki@RamBots" class=wikipagelink>RamBots</a>: when facing a a rammer at super close range, <a href="robowiki@WaveSerpent" class=wikipagelink>WaveSerpent</a> turns as far as possible in  whatever direction its turning (if it would normally turn 2 degrees it turns the full 10). This throws off the prediction most rammers use for closing in and aiming. -- <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a>  
<li> Hmm, that's a nice technique. I just run directly to the preferred distance when there are no waves, and keep surfin ang using early warning gunheat waves with my distancing making the surfing options moving away at 45 degrees away from perpendicular, which seems to work well against all except <a href="robowiki@RamRod" class=wikipagelink>RamRod</a> (as my surfing currently is rather poor against even simple GF guns). Personally I like the way I do it becuase there are no special cases for ram bots or close distances involved at all, but that technique you use sounds neat too and certainly explains how some of your bots are the best against some <a href="robowiki@RamBots" class=wikipagelink>RamBots</a> besides <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> :) -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

<p>
Bah! I like my <a href="robowiki@RamBot" class=wikipagelink>RamBot</a> supremacy! Besides <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> is already one of the better contenders for that place without that 2 tick edge! ;-) Thanks for the suggestions there also. One other thought, is I might want to make my distancing switch to what people would consider an abnormally close range for a surfer, whenever I'm losing, which could prove effective against better bots because that 2 tick advantage would let me do better close combat surfing than them. Of course, that wouldn't work against the ones that have strong enough distancing to avoid letting me get close, but it might be interesting to try some time.  -- <a href="robowiki@Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I also thought of that, and was plannning to release a special version of <a href="robowiki@DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> that moved in close whenever my hitrate was below a certain percentage =). Also, when you are close in, it is fairly easy to 'shepherd' bots into corners, reducing their maximum escape angles. &lt;evil grin&gt; -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

Well, I've been quiet in the last week or so, but I haven't abandoned Robocode. I got a bit tired of endless failed experiments with <a href="robowiki@RougeDC" class=wikipagelink>RougeDC</a> so I just took a bit of a break. After a few days break, I started on Polylunar, a RR team based around <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> tactics. So far, I have the data sharing, distribution of radar locks, and <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>-style tag team movement working. I just stuck <a href="robowiki@LinearTargeting/NanoLinearTargeting" class=wikipagelink>LinearTargeting/NanoLinearTargeting</a> in it as the gun for now but I plan to move to something a bit more full fledged in a bit. Anyways, here's a little big of hype. It's not even close to as good as <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a> did against twins of Shadow, but of course, Polylunar is still an infant and not even remotely close to as well tuned as <a href="robowiki@LunarTwins" class=wikipagelink>LunarTwins</a>.

Interesting constrast between surival as <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> defined it ("1sts" column) and the "Survival" column. The first of which is survival of the team as a whole while the later of which is per-bot. Part of the reason this is probably like that, is that this current revision or Polylunar has members of the team do absolutely nothing whatsoever when they are not paired a tag team. This means that if I have one bot left it will stop moving/firing and lose no matter what which might explain part of the weird score chart. I plan to add solo-strategies for the bots soon, but that's just one item on a big todo list. I'm thinking I'll use <a href="robowiki@AntiGravityMovement" class=wikipagelink>AntiGravityMovement</a> for un-paired bots except for 1v1 situations where I'll use something else.
