<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

It's a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> that uses <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>, which is not a first, but kinda special. Also, it's the first bot that I've released at version 1.0 =)
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/voidious.mini.Komarious_1.78.jar">http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/voidious.mini.Komarious_1.78.jar</a>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

For a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>, it's about as competitive as it gets. It's at #1 in the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> rankings, around #20 in the general rankings, and has recently just peeked its head above 2,000 in the general rumble.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

A fairly simple <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>, using <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing/PrecisePrediction" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing/PrecisePrediction</a> (courtesy of <a href="robowiki?Rozu" class=wikipagelink>rozu</a>'s mini-predictor from <a href="robowiki?Apollon" class=wikipagelink>Apollon</a>), segmented on <a href="robowiki?LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a> and distance.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

The gun is based on the one from <a href="robowiki?RaikoMicro" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMicro</a> (though has been changed a fair bit now), using <a href="robowiki?GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

<a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>!
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

No melee strategy...
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

No melee awareness at all.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Between rounds, <a href="robowiki?GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> data for gun and movement; nothing between matches.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

It's named after <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/komarivosa/index.html">[Komari Vosa]</a>, an ex-Padawan of Count Dooku's that turned to the dark side. It seemed appropriate since this tank is built using everything I've learned from <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Yes, it's released under the <a href="robowiki?RWPCL" class=wikipagelink>RWPCL</a>.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

I'd really love to take the #1 spot in the mini-rumble, and after some recent improvements as well as code shrinking, I'm optimistic about being able to do it. But the top version of <a href="robowiki?Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> is still a long way ahead of the best Komarious...
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

<a href="robowiki?Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a>, <a href="robowiki?Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a>, <a href="robowiki?Smoke" class=wikipagelink>Smoke</a>, and <a href="robowiki?Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> are its biggest PL challenges. <a href="robowiki?Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> beats her sometimes, too, and is certainly the main <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a> in the ranking tables.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

<UL >
<li> <a href="robowiki?RaikoMicro" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMicro</a> - the gun was originally based on the <a href="robowiki?RaikoMicro" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMicro</a> gun, which I believe is a descendant of <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>'s <a href="robowiki?Tityus" class=wikipagelink>Tityus</a> gun, though it has evolved a lot.
<li> <a href="robowiki?Apollon" class=wikipagelink>Apollon</a> - source of <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing/PrecisePrediction" class=wikipagelink>PrecisePrediction</a> code that <a href="robowiki?Rozu" class=wikipagelink>rozu</a> was kind enough to share.
<li> <a href="robowiki?CustomEvent" class=wikipagelink>CustomEvent</a> waves - I believe <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> was the inventor of the <a href="robowiki?CustomEvent" class=wikipagelink>CustomEvent</a> style wave system that is used to delete the old waves in the <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>, which is also used in the gun. Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
<li> Also the iterative <a href="robowiki?WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> method by <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>, and a very small codesize  <a href="robowiki?BackAsFront" class=wikipagelink>BackAsFront</a> method from <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>Iiley</a>.
<li> <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a> was extremely gracious in showing me a whole bunch of <a href="robowiki?CodeSize" class=wikipagelink>CodeSize</a> optimizations in Komarious, even after I thought I had shrunk it about as much as possible. He also tipped me off to just how important the use of onBulletHitBullet data is in surf stats. Major props to Simonton, especially considering he's the author of K's biggest rival!!

<H4>Comments, questions, feedback:</H4>

<p>
It's nice to realize that Jikes would save me 18 bytes right now... This <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> thing is more fun than I expected. I basically just got the urge to try a <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> while I was waiting for <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>'s rating to stabilize last week, and I got more into it than I had expected. She may take a back seat for a bit, as I'm a bit consumed with Dookious at the moment and I've got a lot of school work in the coming week, but I will definitely be coming back to Komarious later on... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
It seemes that Komarious does not really like rammers, does that mean that rammers belong to the good side? Only six red results in the minirumble, all against those pesty zero-distance fighters. Improving this will not help your ranking, but removing those red results could give some (PL)satisfaction. Btw, when do you start with micro's and/or nano's?  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Actually, I've finally got some anti-rammer code into the next version... It's as simple as firing power 3 bullets against rammers, but it seems to do the trick. I figure that whatever they are worth rating-wise, it is double in the mini rumble, since there are half as many entrants there and most rammers are <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a>. No idea if/when I'll start with micro's and nano's - I would like to make a push for that general <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> throne =) In fact, I can't believe I'm spending any time on this <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> thing, but I have just gotten sucked in! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Also, yes, it must mean <a href="robowiki?RamBots" class=wikipagelink>RamBots</a> are good. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
A couple fine results this evening in my dev versions...
<p>
<pre>
1st: voidious.mini.Komarious 1.2*	3867	1750	350	1469	294	3	0	35	0	0
2nd: kawigi.sbf.Barracuda 1.0		80	0	0	77	0	2	0	0	35	0

1st: voidious.mini.Komarious 1.2*	2988	1000	200	1586	189	1	12	20	15	0
2nd: pez.mini.Pugilist 2.3		2266	750	150	1211	153	1	0	15	20	0
</pre>
<p>
Don't worry, <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>... It gives a close match, but usually loses to <a href="robowiki?Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I'm glad I wrote that <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing/Tutorial" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing Tutorial</a>: Tonight I changed K's surfing to precisely predict the intercept tick (like I did there), instead of just precisely iterating over a guesstimated # of ticks. I don't know what I was thinking with that - it saved 10 bytes, too. This is just sweet in a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>:
<p>
<pre>
1st: voidious.mini.Komarious 1.23	3639	1750	350	1283	256	0	0	35	0	0
2nd: kawigi.sbf.Barracuda 1.0		34	0	0	34	0	0	0	0	35	0
</pre>
<p>
=) And seems to be beating <a href="robowiki?Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a> consistently now. Maybe I'll take that <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> PL crown for a while, but the gun could still be improved quite a lot, I think. We'll see... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Hmm. "Fixing" that bug from 1.53 in 1.551 - I was trying to do a distancing trick that I use in <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, but used Math.min instead of Math.max by accident - resulted in a 4 point loss. I know there's a lesson here... =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
Ok, 140 bytes free and 20-30 points off the top spot in the mini-rumble. Time to make a push for #1  =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
So I look at the changes in 1.64, and I'm thinking that the correction to the segmentation is probably responsible for most of the points, and the energy tracking stuff is probably negligible. So I run some (fairly long / reliable) tests with just the segmentation stuff changed, and it is about the same as 1.59. I'm quite surprised, but it seems accounting for energy loss / gain from bullet hits was really quite significant! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I am surprised that Komarious lacked that issue till now. Especially a wavesurfer (or any other dodger for that matter) needs to know exactly when the other fires. I know it is a mini, but these details improve your information gathering. Without proper information, your surfing can not be perfect.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Here's a little <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>-ism I'm proud of, though you'll surely groan if you dislike <a href="robowiki?CodeSize" class=wikipagelink>CodeSize</a> constraints ;) Segmentation slices: 0.25, 2.25, 6.25, 7.75: <code>array[(enemyLatVel &gt;= 7.75)? 4 : (int)(LOG_BASE_E_TO_2_CONVERSION_CONSTANT * Math.log(enemyLatVel + 1.75))]</code>. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Alright! Sooo close to 2K in the general rumble, and I think K now has the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> throne by a decent margin. Either that <a href="robowiki?Voidious/SegmentationResearch" class=wikipagelink>Segmentation Research</a> is really good stuff, or it's just helping me to focus my thoughts as I make segmentation changes. Either way, I've now gained quite a few points just guided by that research, with very little outside testing otherwise. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Dunno how long it will last, but Komarious barely got above 2K in the general rumble just now =) Woohoo! <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/Komarious_2k_general_listing.png">[Komarious 2K listing]</a> -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Bloody hell! I actually doubted that was possible in todays RR@H environment. And a really great mini score too. Way to go!  -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Voidious's bots are the new DT's!! His bots must be stopped! (lol, good luck there huh) -- <a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
And I thought getting over 2000 with a mega bot was hard. Amazing job!!! I'm just waiting for the number 1 melee bot now ;). -- <a href="robowiki?Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a>
<p>
Thanks, guys =) I'm flattered by the <a href="robowiki?DT" class=wikipagelink>DT</a> comparison, but I don't think my bots are anywhere close to the level DT was at compared to the competition of its time. <a href="robowiki?Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a>, do you mean #1 melee bot from me?! You are 100 times closer to that than I am, dude ;) (But I might try my hand at melee again soon...) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
You're so dominant in one-on-one there's not much else for you to do :). I might move into melee again soon, I just need the motivation to make a decent melee pattern matcher. --- <a href="robowiki?Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a>
<p>
I know what your doing! Your attempting to make Komarious break 2100 in the Minibot rankings... and there is no bot powerful enought to stop you. Reaching for the sky once again. In a few years you will have a nano surfer in the nano 2100's. If Komarious existed back in 2003 its power would be ubsurd, not only for being more powerful then even the latest DT (the king at the time, which was a number of versions behind aswell), but the facto that its a minibot. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
You flatter me =) But you forget one thing - all the bots post-DT that guided me in creating my current bots! I do want to break <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> 2100, but I'm really a little clueless on how to do so at the moment... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

You'd better watch out.  <a href="robowiki?WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> is neck &amp; neck, and I just found about 20 bytes last night (kinda cheap trick, but this is no holds barred now). Not sure what to do with them at this point ... but ...  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a> 
<p>
I noticed, and I wish you the best of luck! :) Definitely impressive what you've done with <a href="robowiki?WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a>. I have had a hell of a time trying to find any more points in <a href="robowiki?Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> since 1.712, but maybe losing the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> crown to you will inspire me... By the way, do you use any shortcuts from the new Robocode, like the Rules class? I could find some bytes there, too, I think.  -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Yes I do.  Twice, I think, for bullet velocity (mine and the enemy's).  Are there shortcuts besides using the Rules class?  I also have the questionable practice of running only on my own machine.  I wish I didn't have to, though!  It would be a lot nicer to see faster results.  Darn strings.  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
A shortcut I like from Java 1.5 is Math.signum :-) -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
(Edit conflict) There's only two other useful methods, robocode.util.Utils.normal<a href="robowiki?RelativeAngle" class=wikipagelink>RelativeAngle</a> and Utils.normalAbsoluteAngle<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=AbsoluteAngle" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, for normalizing angles from -Pi to Pi and 0 to 2*Pi, respectively. I think that's right, you could check the <a href="robowiki?Komarious/Code" class=wikipagelink>Komarious source</a> to make sure. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I think you switched them, relative angles are from -pi to pi. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Er, right. Sorry, I was hungry and rushing off to pizza ;) I edited the comment so as not to confuse anyone. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Oh, I see.  I didn't even know those were new.  Well, yes, I also use all of those listed.  :)  Except maybe the absolute angle one.  What would checking the Komarious source do again? -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
The Utils ones aren't new, but they are useful. I just mentioned it as a reference for the Utils.* methods because I thought I might have gotten them wrong. ;) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
If you really got in there I cranked on the code size I bet you could free up a lot. I'm continually surprised - just when I'm starting to think I've got it down as far as it will go, something else gives.  Hey - I'll race you to 2100 ...  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
Totally up for a race to 2100, but I'm skeptical of my own chances of winning =) I dunno, at one point when I thought it was already quite <a href="robowiki?CodeSize" class=wikipagelink>CodeSize</a> optimized, I managed to squeeze another 150 or so bytes out of it (that was with zero change in code functionality); I am really not sure there's much left. But I do still have 20 bytes free, I could possibly shrink things a little more, and there's the Rules.* methods. Really, though, I just don't even know what else I can do even if I had 50 bytes free... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Let me know if you come up with any great ideas.  I have - I think it is 44 bytes free now.  ;)  To be fair, I'll go log my version history, since I get to benefit from studying yours :).  (Though, to tell you the truth, I don't know if it has changed anything I've done so far).  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
I have had ideas that I thought were good, but none of them has gained me any points lately. Komarious always moves away from the enemy at a specific angle - I thought making it move away more when it's closer and stay perpendicular at the "desired" distance would be preferable, but it gained me no points at all (can do this in maybe 20 bytes in Komarious). I also thought further refinement of bullet power management could gain a few more points, but I haven't been able to do any better than my first attempt at it. I figured the <a href="robowiki?RollingAverage" class=wikipagelink>RollingAverage</a> depth I used in my surfing or the length of the WallStick<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=WallStick" class=wikipageedit>?</a> could probably be tuned a little more, but again, no luck. If you don't have any anti-rammer code, that might help; a CurveFlattener<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=CurveFlattener" class=wikipageedit>?</a> against bots that are beating you hard might help if you have room, but it would be tough to get it right. For now, I am probably just going to keep trying some little tweaks to things that I think could probably be tuned up... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> Actually, I was wrong, it's more like 30 bytes base or 40 bytes for a more polished version. Either way, I tried it in the 1.5* versions and it didn't help... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
</UL>
<p>
A simple and effective (I think ;-) ) curve flattener would be to simply log every wave as a hit, whether it hits or not. If you can think up a simpler one, tell me! =) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
You are right about that. However, you will lose performance against most bots if you don't weight "real" hits a lot more; you will also lose performance if you enable your flattener <em>at all</em> against weak or mid-range opponents. (Both just based on my own experiences, of course.) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Yeah, you want to score better agains HOT than against a learning gun. I was just thinking of a lightweight (in codesize) way to implement this, and something like
<pre> if(flat)onHitByBullet(null);</pre>
would work very well. If I remember right, DT did this exclusively as movement, correct? -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
It will feel a little weird if Komarious 1.78 takes back the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> throne - both the huge impact of using onBulletHitBullet and the <a href="robowiki?CodeSize" class=wikipagelink>CodeSize</a> crunching to fit it in were shown to me by <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>! =) I guess that's how it goes with <a href="robowiki?OpenSource" class=wikipagelink>OpenSource</a> Robocode bots sometimes, though. I'll just have to give him some big fat credit in the bot info above... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
It works both ways, my friend.  <a href="robowiki?WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> wouldn't be good at all if I hadn't studied Komarious.  Besides, I bet I can free up about 60 more bytes in <a href="robowiki?WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> with no sweat - one of them a change that I'm 80% confident will boost my score.  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
Watch out!  <a href="robowiki?WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> is slowing creeping up to dethrone Komarious upon the wonderful, mysterious tide of The Rating Drift!  -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
