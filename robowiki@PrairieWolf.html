<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>By <a href="robowiki?David_McCoy" class=wikipagelink>David McCoy</a>. This is a very advanced robot, with a <a href="robowiki?Smorgasbord" class=wikipagelink>smorgasbord</a> of techniques to choose from. And it does. <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> learns about its enemies. And keeps record of those informations, so even if it was weeks since your bot was up against <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a>, he will remember. While most robots I have checked out have source code included, <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> has not. David has even obfuscated the <a href="robowiki?Java" class=wikipagelink>Java</a> byte code so peeking at class names or disassembly of the byte code won't tell you anything (not that I have tried the latter, it's a guess). But David does not keep all info about his bot secret. Far from it. It even has a loaded home page of it's own at:

This is one impressive bot! It hasn't been updated for ages and ages. Still it gives even the mighty <a href="robowiki?DT" class=wikipagelink>DT</a> a fight. Something that none of my bots have done since DT 1.61. The Robocode community really lacks the active participation of David McCoy<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=McCoy" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. I think he would have been able to push all kinds of limits to current robocoding. I have let myself be inspired by PW in the development of <a href="robowiki?Swiffer" class=wikipagelink>Swiffer</a>. There are possibilities to explore with multi-mode stuff. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

Wow. This was an early benchmark-bot in the development of Dookious, but I haven't looked at it in a while. Working on 0.71, I've got Dookious doing much better against many of his <a href="robowiki?ProblemBots" class=wikipagelink>ProblemBots</a>... but he's getting his butt royally kicked by <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a>. I may end up taking a loss to him in my efforts to reach The2000Club! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

I might be upset about it if this last version didn't go so well otherwise... But since it did go well, it's kind of cool that <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> is one of six losses for <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> 0.791. Very impressive! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

You just need to work on your gun. <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> is impressive indeed. Work with your gun until you don't risk losing against it and you will probably have improved your ranking even more. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

It's funny how things work. A change that clearly bolsters my TC scores is to wait until my gun is turned. So I tested against <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a>, since he beat Dookious 0.791. And I realized that after a few rounds, Dookious would never fire, because PW would get into his "vibrating" movement mode that alternates between -1.0 and 1.0 velocity; Dookious keeps trying to fire ahead of him every tick, and the gun never catches up. If PW hadn't beaten 0.791, I probably wouldn't have noticed this possibility before pushing this change out... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
