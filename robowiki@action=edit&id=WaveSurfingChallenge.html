The WaveSurfingChallenge gives you a way to measure your bot&#39;s ability to avoid getting hit by very simple targeting systems in long battles. The WaveSurfingChallenge/FastLearning pits you against the same bots in 35 round battles like the ones in the RoboRumble@Home. You may also want to check out these other movement challenges:

* WaveSurfingChallenge/FastLearning - Another version of this challenge, with short battles.
* MovementChallenge - A measure of your bot&#39;s performance against a wide variety of bots.
* MovementChallenge2K6 - An updated version of the MovementChallenge with more advanced challenge bots.
** WaveSurfingChallenge2K6 - A component of the MovementChallenge2K6, similar to this one but adds a circular targeting bot.

&#39;&#39;&#39;Directions&#39;&#39;&#39;

Here&#39;s how you run a WaveSurfingChallenge:
* Get the reference bots here: http://davidalves.net/robocode/WaveSurfingChallengeBots.jar 
* Bot A fires with HeadOnTargeting, Bot B fires with LinearTargeting. Source code for both bots is included.
* Run 1000 rounds against each of them, or 30 seasons of 35 round battles for the /FastLearning version of this challenge.
* Arena size 800 x 600
* Everything else set to Robocode defaults
* You are not allowed to fire any bullets

Your bot&#39;s score is average amount of life you had at the end of each round. 100 means that the reference bot never hit you. You calculate your score like this: 
 100 - (reference bot&#39;s bullet damage score / 1000)

Great score David! -- [[PEZ]]

Cant believe that Shiva only scores around 89% overall. Hope i did something wrong when testing :((( --[[deathcon]]

Just about everyone was scoring lower than that at first. What are your individual scores vs. A and B? --[[David Alves]]

Not only that. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter much for the real life performance of a bot. Some of the bots scoring sub 90% before and 97+% today have about the same RR@H score anyway. Shiva is probably alright man. =) -- [[PEZ]]

One problem that axe had was that his anti-ramming code was kicking in on rounds where the WaveSurfingChallenge bot was facing SilverSurfer. Something similar perhaps? --[[David Alves]]

Yeah, the anti-ramming is important in WaveSurfingChallenge, [[Pear]] did this not good, sometimes round begin, he is very close to enemy, but he cannot escape soon(I cannot find a good way to improve this all through), so it get low score here.  -- [[iiley]] 

But... I dont think SilverSurfer has this problem, if he/she has, he/she cannot get as high as 99.9+ score vs BotA.  -- [[iiley]]

Not any more, Axe fixed it. I was saying that deathcon might have some problem like that in Shiva. --[[David Alves]]

Yeah..., maybe he has the same problem with me, now i&#39;m tring to fix it. But it&#39;s hard for my movement. Any way maybe can fix out a little better way.  -- [[iiley]]

Cool down, David, did you did your surfing a especial to simple enemies as CC did?(if been hit times lower than x, then did especially).  -- [[iiley]]

My surfing code doesn&#39;t have any special cases. --[[David Alves]]

Which means you don&#39;t have any visit flattener I guess? CC only activates its flattener when the enemies hit rate goes beyond a certain level. Other than that CC prepopulates its unsegmented hit stat buffer with one GF0 hit before the fight. -- [[PEZ]]

Exactly. I have a flattener but it makes [[Phoenix]] a horrible SlowBot so it&#39;s turned off for now. I&#39;m not sure it helps anyway... it&#39;s probably buggy. --[[David Alves]]

Although GrubbmGrb is in noway a WaveSurfer, the sole purpose of it&#39;s Stop&amp;Go movement is to avoid simple targeters. Therefor I entered it here, and it doesn&#39;t do it that bad. --[[GrubbmGait]]

I know [[Dookious]] is still a ways from being the ideal WaveSurfer, but I figured it couldn&#39;t hurt to add his scores here. -- [[Voidious]]

If a good score doesn&#39;t guarantee real-life performance, does a bad score come with guarantees? :) Yuck.  --[[Corbos]]

Well, it is always nice knowing that your tank is doing well *despite* disappointing challenge scores :) One thing that comes to mind off the bat is that you might not have your EnemyWave segmentation actually in sync with what they are seeing before they fire... There&#39;s some good stuff on that EnemyWave page that&#39;s worth checking out about which tick&#39;s data to segment. (Basically, 2 ticks before the energy drop.) Just a thought, I gotta get back to work... -- [[Voidious]]

Also, this is just a tool to perfect your movement against the two simplest (of many) targeting methods. It just means you will score say 95% against a lineartargetter instead of the possible 99.x%. On the other hand, I&#39;ve read somewhere that you rating will be influenced noticably if you could pump up you score from 95% to 97%. No calculations at hand to prove this though.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

I started work on a combined [[MinimumRiskMovement | MinimumRisk]] and WaveSurfing/ShrapnelSurf type of movement for my melee bot Freya. My first attempt obviously works reasonably well for HOT, but fails miserably for LT... I still have a looooong way to go. But that is part of the fun :) --[[Loki]]

Beat that. ;-) --[[David Alves]]

Loki, is that bvh.mini.Freya or bvh.fry.Freya? --[[David Alves]]

It&#39;s bvh.fry.Freya. I can&#39;t get WS working in a megabot, let alone in a mini :) But i am still working on it. I have slightly better results against BotB... But i have broken something against BotA... B.t.w. i showed the wrong version in the results above, the Freya entered in Melee at this moment doesnot use WS at all. --[[Loki]]

Well I was going to offer to take a look at the code and see if I could spot any problems... but then I opened up the java file and saw &lt;code&gt;++beweging.aantalBotsingenMetWand;&lt;/code&gt;... Might take a while for me to understand what&#39;s going on in your bot... =P --[[David Alves]]

thanks for the offer! I will struggle some more, keep coding my bots using a combination of Java and Dutch and if i get really stuck, you can always enter the code in Altavista&#39;s Babelfish :) It gives &#39;comprehensible&#39; translations like &quot;++ movement.number collision with partition;&quot;. At least 4 out of 5 words are correct! --[[Loki]]

Evader is failing miserably...due to it&#39;s bad WallAvoidance...I&#39;ll upload new results once that&#39;s fixed --[[Starrynte]]
* Lol, in one of my testing, it &#39;accidentally&#39; (not) WallSmoothed right into the BotA (when it was disabled) and killed it - free points --[[Starrynte]]
