20 December, 2003 - No hype this time just a release. No <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> this time. I have corrected a small gun error in that I introduced in .65. This version has an untested movement system in it. I am too tired to actually test in beyond making sure that it actually worked without errors. I have no idea how it is going to work in actual practive so this should be an adventure. The new movement system is designed to be adaptive in a very simple fashion. 
<p>
11 December, 2003 - Released the latest install of Jekyl and Hyde. This will be the last release of <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> too. I think he has served his purpose. I only release <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> here to compare with <a href="robowiki@BlackPearl" class=wikipagelink>BlackPearl</a>. I will remove <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> from the RR@H once he stabelizes and I can see where they end up relative to each other. It is my belief that they should end up very close together. Changes in this release:
<UL >
<li> Moved to a gun using doubles and rolling averages for the visits
<li> Added a data compression routine to make data as small as possible
<li> Implemented <a href="robowiki@Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>'s scoring module to make intelligent decisions in what to save. Currently the threshold is set at 70%
<li> Reverted movement to an older version as the tweaks since then did not seem to make things better
<li> Shorted the stand off distance significantly to see how well this works against enemies.
</UL>
<p>
9 December, 2003 - I am cleaning up my wiki page as there seems to be a ton of content and I am tried of scrolling through it all. In development news, I have added a data compression algorithm to my data savings mechanism. I am getting a 4:1 to one or so compression before zipping the file. I am also almost through hacking in <a href="robowiki@Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>'s scoring mechanism into place. After I get those through I am going to run some tests to see if it is worth while to release this version into the wild. After that I will not be working on targeting much as I think my movement is due for an overhaul.
<p>
11:00PM - Just a quick note to show that my guns are still in the same neighborhood after the new data compression algorithm was run. These are final results for 2 different TC Quick runs. I think the compression was a success =^&gt;

11:45PM - I have finally hacked in <a href="robowiki@Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>'s <a href="robowiki@CalculatingScore" class=wikipagelink>CalculatingScore</a> into Jekyl now as well. With my new data compression, some intelligence on when to save, and some new found decision making on what to delete when I am at max capacity I finally feel like my data management is complete. I am running some test leagues tonight to see what the results look like. If all goes well it will be back to the movement labratory for me.
<p>
02:00AM - Can not believe I am still up this late. First round of testing with Jekyl went well. After 50 rounds vs. the whole RR@H Jekyl places third. While I know this is not an indication of where he would actually finish it is a strong indication that he will be a strong release. I am using <a href="robowiki@Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>'s scoring modeule to determine which data to save. I had originally set the threshold for data saving at 60%. At that level, I only stored data on 60 bots (all in under 45 KB). Not quite up to <a href="robowiki@SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a> standards yet but I think that my gunnery is finally coming around to the point where I think it should be. Jekyl seems to learn quickly too which is nice. I am running one more test, with the confidence factor raised to 70%, and I will see how it goes. I am about to declare the guns a success.

Currently on my todo list:
<UL >
<li> Tweak movement.
<li> Research <a href="robowiki@Paul_Evans" class=wikipagelink>Pauls</a>'s suggestion to base my window size on number of observations.
<li> Develop a melee gun.
<li> Re-work the melee movement system to be a more effective melee participant.
</UL>

<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

Target orbit in <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>. <a href="robowiki@AntiGravityMovement" class=wikipagelink>Antigravity</a> in melee. All of my other movement ideas have been refactored out.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

Jekyl uses a Wave system to fire. I have also added a Kernel Density Estimator for smoothing the stats.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It dodges now. If I have spoken with you about it, then you know how. If I have not, well if you ask I am sure I will tell you. It is really not that complicated an effort.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

For melee it uses anti-gravity movement. For one-on-one it uses target orbit.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> ?</H4>

Who ever is closest.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Saves everything it can for as long as it can.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

It is an anagram of first initials in my famlies names.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Not yet. Maybe some day. 
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Everything I am working on is on the page above.
<p>
<H4><a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a></H4>

I am starting to get an extreem disliking for <a href="robowiki@VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a>. I am not quite ready to declare it a <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a> yet, but I must admit it is coming close. 
26 Oct, 2003 - I am starting to search for Harpoons <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

It started life as <a href="robowiki@SnippetBot" class=wikipagelink>SnippetBot</a> (I skipped <a href="robowiki@MyFirstRobot" class=wikipagelink>MyFirstRobot</a>). I then used the Secrets of the Robo Code Masters to add in functionality. A lot of the ideas in Jekyl have also come from these pages and others just like it.

<em><strong>Other people's comments: </strong></em><p>
Seems kind of weird that others might want to comment without being forced but you never can tell =^&gt;

Come on dude. Release that new Jekyl now. Your subtle way of building its hype really works on me! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
In my testing there seems a bug be a bug in new version of Jekyl and <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a>:
<pre>

--  <a href="robowiki@Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>
<UL >
<li> This will be fixed in the next deploy. I forgot to wrap the error in a debug check. Jeykl and <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> will perform normally without the file being there. I have added some switches for testing and debugging purposes and I did not want to leave the file around and face the same problems <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a> had with Tron.
</UL>
<p>
Watch out for "intelligent" descisions on what to save dude. =) Done right I am sure it can give an edge, done wrong it will lower your rating. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<UL >
<li> Actually I am pretty sure that I broke the gun with a global search and replace I did just before deploy to remove some debugging code. I should have this fixed in short order. Right now I am pretty certain that the Jekyl and <a href="robowiki@MrHyde" class=wikipagelink>MrHyde</a> that are in the rumble at the moment are using <a href="robowiki@HeadOnTargeting" class=wikipagelink>HeadOnTargeting</a> :( -- <a href="robowiki@Sparafucil3" class=wikipagelink>jim</a>
