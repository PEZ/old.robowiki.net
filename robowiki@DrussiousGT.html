<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>A combination of Dookious' gun, and <a href="robowiki?DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a>'s movement. Ranked 2097 after 1700+ battles.
<p>
So <a href="robowiki?DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a>'s movement needs to improve 26 points worth. And, at this level in the rankings, Dookious' gun is 39 points stronger than Raiko's.
<p>
If <a href="robowiki?DrussiousGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussiousGT</a> 2.0 ends up 8-10 points above <a href="robowiki?DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a> (which is how it's looking), I think that gives you a high likelihood of having the strongest DC gun out there - and if not, very close to it. Nice job! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
What about Simontons? Or Shadows? --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Well, this result shows that Dooki's gun is 9-10 points stronger than <a href="robowiki?DrussGT" class=wikipagelink>DrussGT</a>'s. Simonton's gun on Dooki's movement (Dookiton<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=Dookiton" class=wikipageedit>?</a>) showed a diff of 10-11 points. With drift and the different movements, you cannot make a sure call, but they are definitely very close. From what I've seen, I didn't think <a href="robowiki?Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> (or <a href="robowiki?Chalk" class=wikipagelink>Chalk</a>) were quite within 10 points of Dooki's gun, but I could certainly be wrong. Where's that <a href="robowiki?WSGunChallenge" class=wikipagelink>WSGunChallenge</a> when you need it... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I'm surprised how strong the gun is! It just goes to show that the <a href="robowiki?TargetingChallengeRM" class=wikipagelink>TargetingChallengeRM</a> doesn't show anything about rumble performance. The time-since-lateral-direction-change attribute didn't help at all in the TCRM, but it boosted me 5+ points in the rumble!
<p>
So there are still 12 points in my movement....urgh. I'll have to give my 'random segment' idea an overhaul. And maybe a flattener as well. I was really hoping that my movement was stronger than that, after all the work I've put into it. I must have spent at least 10 times as much work on the movement as on the gun, and it turns out that the movement is the one that's lacking more. And I'll have to try and make a more memory-efficient way of storing my buffers. Having lots of dimensions with a size of 1 takes more memory, I think. And it's slower to load and retrieve them. But I still have some gun ideas, so watch out! Thanks for the use of your gun, <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>!-- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>

<li> Don't sweat it, man, your movement rocks! There simply are more points in movement than in targeting at the higher levels, so while "lacking more" is true in terms of raw RR points, there are just more points to be had, I think. <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> is a lot more complex than targeting. I'm sure I've spent at least as much total time in the <a href="robowiki?MovementLaboratory" class=wikipagelink>MovementLaboratory</a> as you have, and you're only 12 points away. =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

<li> I think a lot of my movement pains are self-inflicted, because of me choosing the GotoSurfing<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=GotoSurfing" class=wikipageedit>?</a> approach =). The hardest part was getting the second-wave surfing down, and even now I think there are a few bugs in that. I know one of my speed optimizations occasionally malfunctions, especially when I'm <a href="robowiki?WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a>. But my movement would be at least 3x as slow (which would mean skipping turns) if I fixed it 'properly', so now I need a fancy detection algorithm to check when it's not returning the correct results...you get the idea =). I also need a major restructure....there hasn't been <em>any</em> refactoring in the movement since 0.3.0 =). <code>Let me just add another parameter here, that can't hurt....and what about some different functionality when I call it with a null value...that sounds cool ;-) </code>-- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
