The wiki had bandwidth exceeded problems on the last hosting service. I'm now trying to run it from the same host as I run <a rel="nofollow" href="http://halowiki.net">[halowiki.net]</a> from. It's a VPS on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://powervps.com">http://powervps.com</a>. While halowiki.net seems fast and responsive there, this old wiki runs a bit slow. But I think it's stable at least.
<p>
Let me know if something is suddenly not working. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Indeed a bit slow, but acceptable. And good to find that you host a wiki about another game, though I don't play Halo. -- <a href="robowiki?Jonathan" class=wikipagelink>Jonathan</a>
<p>
If you type <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robowiki.net">http://robowiki.net</a> it shows the Apache page, if you type <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki">http://robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki</a> it works fine. -- <a href="robowiki?StefW" class=wikipagelink>StefW</a>
<p>
That's odd. Both works for me. Anyone know the proper Apache directive to redirect that shortcut to the script? -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Last night it worked fine but now it has stopped working. -- <a href="robowiki?StefW" class=wikipagelink>StefW</a>
<p>
Now then? -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
It works now, thanks! -- <a href="robowiki?StefW" class=wikipagelink>StefW</a>
<p>
It was a stupid error. And it's me owing the thanks really. Thanks! -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
It appears that the www address (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robowiki.net">http://www.robowiki.net</a>) resolves to the old site. When I ping it I get 66.235.184.103 versus 205.234.96.227. I suppose it might be a cached entry on a name server and fix itself. Thanks for all of your work on the wiki!  --<a href="robowiki?Corbos" class=wikipagelink>Corbos</a>
<p>
Actually I wrongly assumed I was using CNAME for the www DNS entry. Fixed it now. Can take a while to propagate I guess. Thanks! I just never use www prefixes for anything unless I must. =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Vic_Stewart" class=wikipagelink>Vic Stewart</a> informed me that the bandwidth problem was due to the Yahoo search bot going nuts on the site. And since it runs a bit slow on this site we're now moving back. I won't copy the updates over. I have just changed the DNS pointers. Which means we will need to manually update the new-old wiki. To access the temporary wiki enter <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vps.robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki">http://vps.robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki</a> It's just a couple of pages we need to bother with. Please assist with it if you can. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I think the wiki is up to date now. Only the changes history that gets a bit confused with me as the author of those latest diffs. But it's how it is. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

The site was shut down due to it exceeding it's bandwidth limit! I've now bought 2 years of hosting from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://site5.com/">http://site5.com/</a>. I'm pretty sure we won't have bandwidth limit problems now. And to me it seems pretty responsive too. But since it costs me money I will ask you people for help and provide a "donate" button where anyone can chip in to keep the site up and to keep it ad free.
<p>
I did the transfer in a great hurry. Please let me know if there is anything that doesn't work now that used to work. And sorry if there are updates missing. I used the latest nightly backup for the transfer. But maybe when they release the lock on the old host we can manually transfer any edits made there that didn't follow to this host.
<p>
Sorry for the inconvenience. I should have made this move earlier.

Are there search robots around again? Remember the robots-file to prevent that. -- <a href="robowiki?Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
<p>
Yep. I'm using this since some months back: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robowiki.net/robots.txt">http://robowiki.net/robots.txt</a> but misbehaving bots don't bother reading that file I guess... -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Hey! <a href="robowiki?RoboWiki" class=wikipagelink>RoboWiki</a> just recieved its first donation. I'm not sure the donor wishes I reveal his name, so I won't. Anyway, almost two months of hosting came that way. Many thanks kind donor! -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Maybe we should have a page listing who has donated, with anonymous as a possible entry? Also do not be afraid of donating small amounts, it all adds up. No I'm not in any way involved in the money collecting effort, or the actal money, other than the fact that I'm about to donate. :-). By the way if you are looking for the donate button and couldn't find it, just like me, the reply I just got from <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> was this: "It is well hidden at the bottom of the page." Do I feel stupid... -- <a href="robowiki?Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
<p>
Anyone who wants to let people know he/she has donated can from now use the title "<a href="robowiki?RoboWiki" class=wikipagelink>RoboWiki</a> Donor" on their member page. Pulsar, you already contribute heavily by hosting the <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home. But your donation is welcome anyway. =)
<p>
I've now checked the latest updates on the old host and luckily they were all transfered here.
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
The image asking for donations is not showing. -- <a href="robowiki?Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<p>
It is showing here, but not while I'm editing this page. -- <a href="robowiki?Jonathan" class=wikipagelink>Jonathan</a>
<p>
How much bandwidth do you guys use in a single month? I might be able to provide better hosting for free. Drop me a line, aaron.krill@gmail.com -- <a href="robowiki?AaronKrill" class=wikipagelink>AaronKrill</a>
<p>
I can only answer for the rumble itself (<a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> has the wiki) but I haven't measured the bandwidth usage there. Never seen any bad  effect of it, on the other hand it is running on a 10/10mbit connection (soon to be 100/10mbit as a free upgrade). The hosting is not a problem for me, it is just fun, some electricity &amp; noise from an extra server :) -- <a href="robowiki?Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
