<H2>What's new?</H2>

<UL >
<li> June 1 2004 - Version 0.4.1s released
<UL >
<li> Now <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> (well, tries to)
<li> Lower resolution in the gun segmentation to make it learn quicker.
</UL>
<li> January 10 2004 - Version 0.4.0 released
<UL >
<li> A DesperateUpdate<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=DesperateUpdate" class=wikipageedit>?</a> (tm)
<li> Added a shrinked version of <a href="robowiki?RandomMovementBot" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovementBot</a> movement.
<li> Added the <a href="robowiki?MusashiTrick" class=wikipagelink>MusashiTrick</a>
<li> To fit these I had to remove the smoothing when updating guess factor visit counts. But I don't think it really makes a very big difference. And even if it makes a difference I'm not sure in which direction that difference goes. =)
<li> I also had to remove the decay functionality, which is probably a bad idea now when <a href="robowiki?AdaptiveMovement" class=wikipagelink>AdaptiveMovement</a> bots are becoming legio.
<li> Learning the lesson taught by <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> Verti now fire waves every scan. This should more than compensate the loss in learning speed from removing smoothing.
</UL>
<li> December 19 2003 - Finally I think I have a new version of this bot that I dare release - 0.3.3
<UL >
<li> With some help from <a href="robowiki?Jim" class=wikipagelink>Jim</a> and <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a> I managed to focus on the right things I think. New in this version is:
</UL><OL>
<OL >
<li> Increased the number of guess factors and now does some smoothing when updating the <a href="robowiki?VisitCountStats" class=wikipagelink>VisitCountStats</a> (I think this is something <a href="robowiki?Frakir" class=wikipagelink>Frakir</a> thought up). This should mean faster learning.
<li> Defaults to 2.8 in fire power. Should make Verti hit its enemy a little more often.
<li> Mirroring the vertical position segment. This means higher granularity with less segment buckets. Yeay! Less buckets means faster learning.
<li> An attempt to make Verti's near wall movement less predictable. Though from what I can observe it doesn't seem to work. All ideas around this problem are greatly welcome.
<li> Code cleanup and shrinking. (Living with zip-files without the ".zip" extention saved me 38 bytes!
</OL>
</OL>
<li> November 9 2003 - Failed to take the 6th win in a row in <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> mini 1-v1. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robocode.yajags.com/20031108/mini-1v1.html">http://robocode.yajags.com/20031108/mini-1v1.html</a>
<UL >
<li> Though it must represent yet another quite funny rating since Verti won all of it's battles and scored highest. <a href="robowiki?Griffon" class=wikipagelink>Griffon</a> who won this round (yay!!) also won all its battles. But <a href="robowiki?GlowBlowAPM" class=wikipagelink>GlowBlowAPM</a> which came second actually lost 2 or 3 battles.
<li> I'm still quite pleased since Verti is undefeated. =)
</UL>
<li> November 1 2003 - Version 0.3.1 released
<UL >
<li> Now it should better evade when it is pushed back against a wall. Seems to make a big difference in it's performance.
</UL>
<li> October 29 2003 - Version 0.3 released
<UL >
<li> Shoots power 3 bullets all the time.
<li> Doesn't use different movement modes. Just one, a bit randomized. I'm not sure it's better (<a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> will tell), but it's cleaner.
<li> Code size is now 1386 - and that's with <a href="robowiki?VisitCountStats/LimitFileSize" class=wikipagelink>VisitCountStats/LimitFileSize</a> added. 
</UL>
<li> October 26 2003 - Victory number 5 (out of 5 tries) and a new division high score in <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a>: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robocode.yajags.com/20031025/mini-1v1.html">http://robocode.yajags.com/20031025/mini-1v1.html</a>
<UL >
<li> Much to my (and probably everyone elses) surprise VL also came out best overall minibot this season. =)
</UL>
<li> October 25 2003 - <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> goes <a href="robowiki?OpenSource" class=wikipagelink>OpenSource</a> - <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach/Code" class=wikipagelink>/Code</a>
<li> October 18 2003 - Yet another solid victory in <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a>: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robocode.yajags.com/20031018/mini-1v1.html">http://robocode.yajags.com/20031018/mini-1v1.html</a>
<li> October 12 2003 - A 9 point lead in the <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home mini game: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robowiki.dyndns.org/?RoboRumble/Rankings_minirumble_20031012">http://robowiki.dyndns.org/?RoboRumble/Rankings_minirumble_20031012</a>
<UL >
<li> Is <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> the best 1-v-1 minibot or not? =)
</UL>
<li> October 11 2003 - Yet another highscore by <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> in the <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> mini 1-v-1 division: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robocode.yajags.com/20031011/mini-1v1.html">http://robocode.yajags.com/20031011/mini-1v1.html</a>
<li> October 4 2003 - Wins <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> 1v1 mini division again! And sets a ranking high score at that. =)
<UL >
<li> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://robocode.yajags.com/20031004/mini-1v1.html">http://robocode.yajags.com/20031004/mini-1v1.html</a>
</UL>
<li> October 4 2003 - Version 0.2.2 released
<UL >
<li> Some changes in survival and gun power strategies in order to score a bit higher against the <a href="robowiki?ProblemBot" class=wikipagelink>ProblemBot</a>s.
</UL>
<li> September 30 2003 - Version 0.2.1 released
<UL >
<li> Chooses movement strategy based on situation rather than on which opponent it is facing.
<li> Simpler design, now 1446 in codesize.
<li> Beats all minibots according to my <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home@Home tests: <a rel="nofollow" href="http:/robocode/uploads/pez/VL0.2.1-RatingDetails.html">http:/robocode/uploads/pez/VL0.2.1-RatingDetails.html</a>
</UL>
<li> September 27 2003 - Wins <a href="robowiki?RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> 1v1 mini division!
<li> September 26 2003 - Version 0.2 realeased.
<UL >
<li> <strong>HUGE</strong> targeting bug fixed. Now the gun is more up to my expectations.
<li> Now uses two movement modes. To deal with mirroring bots.
</UL>
<li> September 21 2003 - First test version (0.1) released.
</UL>
<H2>What's special about it?</H2>

<UL >
<li> It's the first bot with this kind of movement I think. And if not, I think it's first with using the movement characteristics to simplify and specilize its targeting. If not, well, then nothing's special about it. =) If you don't count that it has a wrongly spelt "Leech" in it's name ... 
</UL>
<H2>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H2>

Top-10 material I would say.

<H2>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H2>

Verti-movement:
<p>
It tries to stay at a fix, close, distance along the X axis from its enemy. And for the Y coordinate it copies the enemy's Y coordinate, and then applies <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> along the Y axis.
<H2>How does it fire?</H2>

A <a href="robowiki?ReducedDimensionalSegmentation" class=wikipagelink>ReducedDimensionalSegmentation</a> <a href="robowiki?GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> gun.
<H2>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H2>

<a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>.
<H2>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H2>

This bot doesn't know about <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>Melee</a> battles.
<H2>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H2>

Nothing between battles. All sorts of stats between rounds. 
<H2>Where did you get the name?</H2>

It just reflects its behaviour I think. With some bad spelling added.
<H2>Can I use your code?</H2>

Indeed, it's released under the <a href="robowiki?RWPCL" class=wikipagelink>RWPCL</a>. Included in the jar file. Ugly though.
<H2>What's next for your robot?</H2>

<UL >
<li> Dunno. This is not really a bot under development. Just added <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> for the fun of it.

Quite impressive! It brings also some fresh air into Robocode, currently dominated by "long range-low fire power" bots, by mantaining a valiant close combat always at less than 300 from the enemy. -- <a href="robowiki?Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>
<p>
Thanks! And with "high-power bullets" =). Something for the <a href="robowiki?PointBlankCompetition" class=wikipagelink>PointBlankCompetition</a>, in'it? -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Cool done,PEZ,Creative movement,cool way to did movement and the movement is cool for gun to save datas,and its color is nice.~;] it beat <a href="robowiki?BlestPain" class=wikipagelink>BlestPain</a> in 300 rounds in my testing~;[.  -- <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>
<p>
Its looks like two dancers when it fighting <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>,haha~~~ nice dancing.  -- <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>
<p>
=) <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> never objects to a close dance either. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Wow. After watching <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> fight, I am extremely impressed with its movement. The way it moves is brilliant. ...I had more to say on it, but it's 4am and I forget now what I was thinking about. In any case, I like the way it assaults the enemy. I have been brooding over various firepower algorithms lately, and basically have decided that I like shooting high power, and I'm very tempted to make <a href="robowiki?Fractal" class=wikipagelink>Fractal</a> be more aggressive(sp?) in future versions. I'm wondering whether or not I should make it always passive, or always aggressive, or to have both and be able to learn which to use on whom; the problem is, I can never seem to write a powerful gun. No bot I have ever written is powerful on offense. But I like how <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> assaults the enemy, and with Fractal's design I think I could make it house a more powerful gun and be able to do well in an offensive mode. Maybe I should have written this in Fractal's discussion area instead of here. Ah well. Great bot PEZ =). You've given inspiration that it is possible for an offensive bot to succeed in the RR@H. (side note, the current development version of Fractal can pretty consistantly tie the latest <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a>, while Fractal 0.3 gets thrashed by it (it being <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a>). =) A new version will come soon...) -- <a href="robowiki?Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>
<p>
I'm very curious about those other things you had to say about the movement. =) But you bring up two intersting subjects here;
<OL >
<li> Agressiveness vs passiveness, and the full spectra of behaviours in between.
</OL><UL>
<UL >
<li> The first time I made <a href="robowiki?Marshmallow" class=wikipagelink>Marshmallow</a> beat <a href="robowiki?PrairieWolf" class=wikipagelink>PrairieWolf</a> was by making M super agressive. It didn't hold tight since PW has so many modes and soon found the right strategy to counter. It's quite interesting to see that PW beats Verti quite easily. Maybe Verti will force forward a renaissance for the multimode bots? Ever since that ramming Marshmallow I have often tried to make a truly agressive bot (this is what <a href="robowiki?Leach" class=wikipagelink>Leach</a> was about in its early development stages). But every time I thought I had created the ultimatily flat movement at close ranges I still always got trashed when moving in. (This is an effect of the great impact <a href="robowiki?AdvancingVelocity" class=wikipagelink>AdvancingVelocity</a> has on your movement profile. And it is of course also important to have a trustworthy gun for the range of choice.) Then came <a href="robowiki?X-KAM-X" class=wikipagelink>Marcelo</a>'s <a href="robowiki?DevilFISH" class=wikipagelink>DevilFISH</a>, <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>s <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> 1.4 and, to some extent, <a href="robowiki?SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a> 2.11 and proved close combat can work.
</UL>
</UL><OL>
<li> Fire power strategies.
</OL><UL>
<UL >
<li> The choice of fire power strategy not only impacts your survival. It can also lead to increased or decreased segmentation. And the possibility to search for weak spots in your enemys movement, like <a href="robowiki?BlestPain" class=wikipagelink>BlestPain</a>. Or, in it's simpler form like <a href="robowiki?Tityus" class=wikipagelink>Tityus</a> which uses a random (though high) fire power and segments its stats on this parameter. Or you can opt for fast learning and use a constant fire power, like <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a>. This is of course obvious, but nevertheless important. <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> takes it a step further and tries to fixate the distance too. This makes it two segementation dimensions less than <a href="robowiki?GloomyDark" class=wikipagelink>GloomyDark</a> or Tityus have. Which makes the data files much smaller, the learning much faster and still leaves room for a new segmentation dimension. The <a href="robowiki?Smorgasbord" class=wikipagelink>Smorgasbord</a> of fire power strategies is endless of course. I have always thought this is yet another area where DT excels.
</UL>

Now Verti is down on #10 in the rankings BTW. I had hoped it should be able to stay in top-6 (not an arbitrary set). -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I just realized "leech" is spellt "leech" and no other way. Gah! -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I wonder if <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a> has realized yet his bot should be called BlessedPain<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=BlessedPain" class=wikipageedit>?</a> :) -- <a href="robowiki?FnH" class=wikipagelink>FnH</a>
<p>
Ahhh, I have actually wondered about that. Of course, phonetically it is the same. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
"Blest" is a correct spelling of the word "blessed" in old english.  I don't know if this was iiley's intention or not, but it is perfectly acceptable as a bot's name.  Also, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=leach">[leach]</a> is most definitely a word, and it fits perfectly. -- <a href="robowiki?Nano" class=wikipagelink>nano</a>
<p>
Blest and blessed are as good as each other in my book.  I don't see how the definition you linked for leach fits, <a href="robowiki?Nano" class=wikipagelink>Nano</a>, maybe a better explanation is in order. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Maybe it leaches the competition (eh, like making it look pale or some such). =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
<i>leach</i>, <b>v.tr.</b> To empty; drain: “a world leached of pleasure, voided of meaning”<br>
How about "a bot leached of energy, unable to move"?  I know it's less poetic, but Robocode bots are definitely in the business of leaching one another.  I mean, they even steal their opponents' energy just like a leech leaches its host's blood! -- <a href="robowiki?Nano" class=wikipagelink>nano</a>
<p>
Just looked it up, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=blest">[blest]</a> is indeed a valid alternative for blessed (although a bit archaic to my taste) -- <a href="robowiki?FnH" class=wikipagelink>FnH</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>, while it pains me greatly to see Verti that much tougher to kill I still think I should report that you may have a bug in your ramming code. I was playing around with some new <a href="robowiki?VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> killer ideas I had and I have noticed that it tends to miss when it tries to ram. My bot ends up disabled and yours sits there, close to me but having never made contact, while we wat for the timer to expire. Seems like your calculation of my X,Y coordinates are off. I wonder if this may be the source of all your targeting bugs as well. Here's hoping it fixes your bot and degrades it's performance :) FYI: I was testing with Version 1.3.1 -- <a href="robowiki?Sparafucil3" class=wikipagelink>jim</a>
<p>
Thanks! I'm sorry to say that it is not the targeting bug. I reset the Y offest Verti chooses only when the enemy fires. The ramming only works by the X coordinate which means that when the enemy has stopped firing and Verti decides to ram it might get stuck above or below the enemy instead. I wasn't aware of this. Should be easily fixed if I have the bytes for it. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Yeah, I had observed this quite a bit too in my testing, but I forgot to mention it. It happened surprisingly often against my less than intelligent bots. Hopefully you can find the room to fix it ; ) -- <a href="robowiki?Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>
<p>
The problem is that I have made quite a few changes in the development version of Verti. All of which seem to degrade its performance. So I won't release the ramming-fixed Verti any time soon. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Heh, I was wondering when you were going to get round to this.  I think you can squeeze another 60-70 bytes by not reusing the Point2Ds, so possibly you can add some of that functionality back in?  Worth a try. - <a href="robowiki?Jamougha" class=wikipagelink>Jamougha</a>
<p>
Maybe. But I am not sure they give any edge though. Will have to run some heavy testing to find out. Thanks for the shrinking tips! -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
