With a common gun should be able to determine which movement performs best in RoboRumble melee battles. 

Rules:

* Stick [[HawkOnFire]]&#39;s gun on your movement and enter it into the melee rumble.
* Post your results here after your robot has at least 1500 battles, ordered by Rating, descending.

The code for [[HawkOnFire]]&#39;s bullet power selection is.
&lt;pre&gt;setFire(Math.min(Math.min(myEnergy/6, 1300/distanceToTarget), target.energy/3));&lt;/pre&gt;
The gun turn is standard [[HeadOnTargeting]] (shooting towards the last position you&#39;ve scanned the enemy at): &lt;pre&gt;setTurnGunRightRadians(Utils.normalRelativeAngle(absoluteBearing(target.position, myPosition) - getGunHeadingRadians()));&lt;/pre&gt;

The challenge is currently new and open to modification. As of now, I&#39;m leaving radar and target selection non standardized becuase they often have an effect on the movement. It may be better to switch to a stronger gun because a few movements may rely on their gun to attack other robot&#39;s in one-on-one style duels. However, it would mean adding a radar lock and more complex code, so it will be HOT for now (I don&#39;t have any open-source melee bots that would work well anyway). If anyone thinks we need a more structured setting, we could easily switch to [[Coriantumr]]&#39;s gun, radar, and target selection. -- [[Kev]]

Can&#39;t add HawkOnFire for the same reason that you can&#39;t add Komarious to your gun challenge... the rules state that it must be a megabot =P --[[David Alves]]

Again, &quot;rules&quot; really confuse me. -- [[Voidious]]

does this rule concerning botsize matter at all for melee battles? I thought that the scores against bots from the same category are just picked out of the normal battles including also bots from different categories. -- [[rozu]]

Anyway, nice that some of my bots are still around... ;) -- [[rozu]]

Even in melee botsize dependent battles are fought, there are just not many new smallsized bots so it is hard to notice. As for your bots still around . . . as long as your bots are one of the two best in every weightclass, they are allowed to hang around. Although there are a lot of new faces from rank 7 till 20, the first 6 bots (with 2 of you) have not really been threatened in the last two(!!) years.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

The increased number of botsize dependent battles shouldn&#39;t have any affect in the general rumble because a micro bot will eventually fight every opponent and get a rating in the same way as a mega bot. However, this isn&#39;t always true in the melee rumble. My reasoning is that a micro bot in the melee rumble that does well a in a primarily micro bot battle will do better than a mega bot that does well against micro bots because the micro will fight more of the robots it&#39;s good against. On reflection, it seems like this shouldn&#39;t make much of a difference and we might as well not include micro bots in the general rumble if we are this picky about score, so I think I&#39;ll change the rule. -- [[Kev]]

Could we agree on a minimum number of battles of 1500? At that point the ranking should be as stable as it can get in melee.   -- [[GrubbmGait]]
* good idea, a higher number of battles will give more reliable results. But the results in this challenge will never be as exact as in the 1-vs-1 challenges as a drift of pm 4 points with increasing number of battles is not uncommon in the melee rumble. --[[Loki]]

Sounds like a good idea to me also. I&#39;ll add a 1500 battle minimum to the rules. Even if it only gives a general rating, the challenge is still useful; I had no idea [[Logic]]&#39;s movement was so good (and its gun was so bad). -- [[Kev]]

Ouch, I knew that my gun is OK for melee, but i expected that my movement was better than this. There is also s sunny side: if I can get my movement to the level of [[Logic]], I would be #4 !!!  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

I&#39;ve changed my initial contribution to wait until my gun is cool before I fire. HawkOnFire uses a spinning radar and fires blind (in the mainloop), while Griezel uses a meleeradar (lock, fire, spin etc) while in the scannedrobotevent. Maybe it is a good idea to also include the radar from HawkOnFire, but only if it has not to much influence on the movement.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]
* so you have even improved on your gun by wating until its cool! --[[Loki]]
** with Griezel (and Gruwel) I have done that from the beginning, for this challenge I tried to take the gun from HawkOnFire &#39;as is&#39; but that influenced the performance considerately (I could hardly hit SittingDuck :-p). GriezelMRMC still fires HOT and uses the bulletpower of HawkOnFire, I think that is enough to qualify for this challenge.  --[[GrubbmGait]]

For Freya the conclusion is similar: it&#39;s the gun that contributes more to the ranking than the movement. I have always known that, but i find improving movement much harder than improving the gun. --[[Loki]]

I think the radar shouldn&#39;t have much effect on the score, and some movements rely on a radar lock to dected [[EnergyDrop]] for bullet dodging. For now, I&#39;m leaving the radar non-standardized. I&#39;ve also removed some of the sample code because it&#39;s confusing and doesn&#39;t behave the way it should in some cases. The gun doesn&#39;t have to be word for word from [[HawkOnFire]] as long as it&#39;s pure [[HeadOnTargeting]] (although the energy management must stay same). -- [[Kev]]
