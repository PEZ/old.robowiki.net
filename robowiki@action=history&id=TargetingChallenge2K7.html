 The only constructive thought I've had, other than if TC2K7 is necessary, is maybe separating out the surfers into an <a href="robowiki@AntiSurfer" class=wikipagelink>AntiSurfer</a> sub-challenge, since it's such a small effect on RR score but still interesting. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> I have given 2k7 some thought, and I think we should have a surfer challenge. We could cut it up so we have 3 parts of the surfer challenge:<br> <ol><br> <li>Bots without flatteners</li><br> <li>Bots with flatteners</li><br> <li>Bots with flatteners permanently on</li><br> </ol><br> The reason for the 3rd being that some bots have alot of bias of turning on thier flatteners, and as your gun gets good vs unadaptive bots it should get worse vs the flatteners. We could also just cut out number 2 from that list. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a><br> <br> We might just want to have bots with flatteners permanently on or bots with no flatteners at all. Otherwise the score might change a lot depending on whether or not it was enabled, and when. How about this as a list?<br> <br> 5 surfers:<br> * 2 expert surfers, e.g. <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, <a href="robowiki@Phoenix" class=wikipagelink>Phoenix</a>, <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> or <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a><br> * 2 intermediate surfers, e.g. <a href="robowiki@WaveSerpent" class=wikipagelink>WaveSerpent</a>,  <a href="robowiki@Engineer" class=wikipagelink>Engineer</a>, PhoenixOS<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=PhoenixOS" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a><br> * 1 beginning surfer, maybe a version of <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> updated to stay far away?<br> <br> 5 non-surfers:<br> * 2 expert random movers, e.g. <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a> or <a href="robowiki@Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a> (others?)<br> * 2 expert stop-n-go / multimode bots, e.g. <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> or <a href="robowiki@Ugluk" class=wikipagelink>Ugluk</a><br> * 1 beginning random mover, e.g. <a href="robowiki@FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, <a href="robowiki@DuelistMicro" class=wikipagelink>DuelistMicro</a><br> <br> I think we should try to pick bots by people that are active, makes it more interesting. Although we don't have active people in every category I listed above. =P<br>  <br> --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a><br> <br> The surfer breakdown you have there looks good, and actually a lot like my general thoughts for TC2K6. However, I don't think <a href="robowiki@Tigger" class=wikipagelink>Tigger</a> was quite good / stable enough (his WSC scores are not great). I personally like trying to hit <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>, but I'm of the opinion that the reference bots should be <em>fast</em> since we will be running so many battles against them. We should be able to find great surfing movements that are also fast. For what it's worth, I hope Dooki will be much faster when I finish the rewrite, but if it isn't I'd recommend still leaving it out... There is value in having a DC surfer in there, though, so maybe we can check out the speed of both <a href="robowiki@Chalk" class=wikipagelink>Chalk</a> and <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>...<br> <br> What about having 5 surfers in an <a href="robowiki@AntiSurfer" class=wikipagelink>AntiSurfer</a> sub-challenge, and 10 non-surfers in the non-adaptive sub-challenge? Not married to the idea, just a thought. Even with 4 surfers, and 2 expert ones, I feel like TC2K6 has too much emphasis on surfing to accurately reflect the rumble. I like <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> as a reference bot =) I'm really proud of that quick little surfer! <br> <br> * Actually, Komarious may be closer to a beginner surfer than an intermediate surfer... It's not as far from <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> as you might think. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> About the flattener, I'm on the fence about it. Dookious does <em>much</em> better against most guns with its flattener off, but flattening also helps a lot against top guns. It'd be a much easier target for most tanks if we just left the flattener on all the time.<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> I pointed out we could just drop number 2 in my list ;). Actually, my bot Velshea could fill the beginner surfer requirement (as it is and i'm still a beginner at making them). Its not alot better then <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a>, and its movement in the <a href="robowiki@CurveFlatteningChallenge" class=wikipagelink>CurveFlatteningChallenge</a> isn't super as Komarious' is. I would vote for Shadow as a expert surfer and Komarious as a intermediate. I like the idea of Engineer in there with his neural network based surfing, and Dookious with the flattener on might even the scores a bit. Those are my ideas.<br> -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a><br> <br> I guess we can cross <a href="robowiki@WaveSerpent" class=wikipagelink>WaveSerpent</a> off the "intermediate surfers" list =) I know a surfer can get a lot more basic than <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a>, but I'm not sure we should have anything more basic than it as a reference bot. Very few surfers stay that simple, so I'm not sure it's much worth it to tune your gun against something like <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a>. You don't need a decent <a href="robowiki@AntiSurfer" class=wikipagelink>AntiSurfer</a> gun to hit a bot that doesn't roll its stats like most surfers. Compared to every other functional surfer in the rumble, Komari's movement is still very basic - she's got an extremely competent gun (see <a href="robowiki@TargetingChallenge" class=wikipagelink>TargetingChallenge</a> scores) and still barely breaks 2K. <br> <br> What do you guys think of having surfers and non-surfers as sub-challenges? I still like the sound of 10 non-surfers and 5 surfers...<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> I think 10 non surfers is too many. 10 bots total in the challenge is a nice round number. Besides, it's not supposed to be a good predictor of rumble score... it's just supposed to be a challenge! Challenges should be hard, and that means (to me anyway) that we should use bots that are hard to hit, which means not too many non-surfers. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a><br> <br> Hmm, if you say so =) I said something very similar about reflecting RR rating when we were putting together TC2K6, actually. I'm OK with 5 surfers and 5 non-surfers then. I still think it'd be good to also list separate indices for surfers and non-surfers, since the non-surfers score has so much more impact on RR rating. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> We could do it like the MC2K6? --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a><br> <br> Yeah, or just leave the format like 2K6 and add the sub-indices to the results. I kinda do this on the <a href="robowiki@Dookious/DookiSaber" class=wikipagelink>Dookious/DookiSaber</a> page even for the 2K6 results. For TC2K6, after discussing a bit, it was basically put in my hands to put together the final list; I've still got a lot of interesting data from all the tests I ran for that. In particular, there this Excel workbook (3 sheets): <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/tc2k6/tc2k6.xls">[tc2k6.xls]</a>. And a bunch more <a href="robowiki@RoboLeague" class=wikipagelink>RoboLeague</a> results in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/tc2k6/">[that directory]</a>.<br> <br> <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> (expert surfer) and <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> (basic surfer) would be my top candidates among the surfers; <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a> and <a href="robowiki@DuelistMicro" class=wikipagelink>DuelistMicro</a> are probably my top pics among the non-surfers. Not to toot my own horn, I think it'd be great to have <a href="robowiki@Phoenix" class=wikipagelink>Phoenix</a>, <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, or <a href="robowiki@Ascendant" class=wikipagelink>Ascendant</a> in there, since they are probably the best movements in the rumble. <a href="robowiki@Engineer" class=wikipagelink>Engineer</a> is really interesting, too, but I'd have to check how fast it is to execute.<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> (editing conflict with Voidious) I would perfer a benchmark, and since there is such a large diversity of movement types I say we have no more then 2 or 3 surfers at best. My bot, is moot, since as a benchmark, wouldn't do well enough. So I also vote <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> and <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>. I also vote for <a href="robowiki@Lacrimas" class=wikipagelink>Lacrimas</a> which is based off <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a> and uses a more advanced movement then Cigaret, should be used along with perhaps <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a> 3 and its right angle movement, <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> or <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> would be my choice for multi-mode. <a href="robowiki@DuelistMicro" class=wikipagelink>DuelistMicro</a> for its timer based movement. -- <a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a><br> <br> I dunno, I like the idea of 5 surfers, personally. If you want to know how your gun will work in terms of <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> rating points, just focus on the non-surfers like with TC2K6. I'm also starting to think maybe we should limit the number of bots repeated from the other two TC's - it's not like you can't run those tests, too.<br> <br> Just as food for thought, I'll throw out a possible list that comes to mind right now...<br> <br> * <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> - Expert Surfer. We all want to hit Shadow and he's super hard to hit consistently.<br> * Another expert surfer - Not sure, but I'd like <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a>, <a href="robowiki@Phoenix" class=wikipagelink>Phoenix</a>, or <a href="robowiki@Ascendant" class=wikipagelink>Ascendant</a>. I guess I think <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> would be best because it's open source and probably the top rumble movement, but it is also a bit slow like Shadow. I think I can speed it up considerably in the coming weeks, though. Dooki's flattener is pretty well suited for enabling / disabling in this mode of operation, too. (Because I used to be addicted to <a href="robowiki@MovementChallenge" class=wikipagelink>MovementChallenge</a> tests...)<br> * <a href="robowiki@Engineer" class=wikipagelink>Engineer</a> - Intermediate (though almost Expert, probably) surfer. Very unique implementation and adds good variety, just gotta check its execution speed.<br> * PhoenixOS<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=PhoenixOS" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - Intermediate surfer, held its top 10 position for a long time after last update. Open source is good for people to learn from.<br> * <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> - Basic surfer. Functional, bug free, very fast to execute, but super simple and doesn't segment on much. Still relatively tough to hit - Dookious got ~86 scores against it last time I checked.<br> <br> * <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a> - <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a>. In both other TC's, but still super hard to hit.<br> * <a href="robowiki@Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a> (or <a href="robowiki@RaikoMicro" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMicro</a>?) - <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a>. A really good non-surfing movement. Open source. Not active, but not too many random movers coming out these days... Maybe <a href="robowiki@Tityus" class=wikipagelink>Tityus</a> instead?<br> * <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> - Top notch multi-mode movement. Open source.<br> * Another multi-mode bot - <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> is a great reference bot, IMO, but would be nice to get something fresh. Two of <a href="robowiki@Swiffer" class=wikipagelink>Swiffer</a>'s four modes are mirror-ish, so it wouldn't be all that useful in a TC. What about <a href="robowiki@SpareParts" class=wikipagelink>SpareParts</a>? <a href="robowiki@Ugluk" class=wikipagelink>Ugluk</a> could be a good choice, and I think its movement is pretty quick to execute, but it's closed source and it's kinda (but not quite) like a repeat of <a href="robowiki@Butterfly" class=wikipagelink>Butterfly</a>.<br> * <a href="robowiki@Charo" class=wikipagelink>Charo</a> - Micro random mover. Haven't looked closely at it for a while, but <a href="robowiki@Corbos" class=wikipagelink>Corbos</a> is active and it's only a few places ahead of <a href="robowiki@DuelistMicro" class=wikipagelink>DuelistMicro</a> in the micro rankings.<br> <br> Ok, that turned out to be a longer post than expected, but at least it gives us something to talk about ;) I definitely want to hear what some people other than me / Chase-san / David have to say about TC2K7...<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> One thing I like about that list is that there aren't too many reactive movers. There are quite a few in the rumble, but I think a lot of the lower level bots have non reactive movement. I remember <a href="robowiki@GresSuffurd" class=wikipagelink>GresSuffurd</a> gained a couple points in the rumble, but lost TC2K6 scores by adding results from non-firing waves. <br> <br> Having both <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> and <a href="robowiki@Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a> in is kind of reduntant because both have flat, orbital, <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> with very similar movement profiles. I'm also unsure of whether <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> and <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> really qualify as multi-mode because they only have one real movement type (although they would be good challenge bots anyway). The other modes only turn on against simple targeters and won't really appear in the challenge. Besides that, this list looks great to me. -- <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a><br> <br> Actually, I just remembered <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a>'s movement mode changes whenever it dies until it reaches <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a>. When I tested it against the wave surfing challenge bots, <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> got stuck once and switched to its <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> anyway. It would be better to use <a href="robowiki@Thorn" class=wikipagelink>Thorn</a>'s movement instead (which is virtually identical, but doesn't have this problem).  -- <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a><br> <br> Ah, I didn't realize that <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> and <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> were basically <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> against a learning gun. I do think it'd be cool to have one truly <a href="robowiki@MultiMode" class=wikipagelink>MultiMode</a> movement in there. Hmm... -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> The only true <a href="robowiki@MultiMode" class=wikipagelink>MultiMode</a> bots I can think of that are also quite recent are <a href="robowiki@Ugluk" class=wikipagelink>Ugluk</a>/<a href="robowiki@Grishnakh" class=wikipagelink>Grishnakh</a> and <a href="robowiki@ForceMajeure" class=wikipagelink>ForceMajeure</a>, alas both are not open source. <a href="robowiki@Smoke" class=wikipagelink>Smoke</a> can be a replacement for <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a>, although very similar. <a href="robowiki@Vyper" class=wikipagelink>Vyper</a> does seem to do better against GF-guns than <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a>, so maybe is the better choice. Other than  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a><br> <br> I personally wouldn't want to many surfers for the reasons that I don't want it being like 2k6 again where you can get a decent to good score just with a anti-surfer gun as I have, I like a large selection, but I am willing to accept 5 surfers if we are lacking vairation in normal movers. <br> <br> In the non-surfing division I personally like <a href="robowiki@Raiko" class=wikipagelink>Raiko</a>, <a href="robowiki@Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a> (since the other I looked at was rather bad), <a href="robowiki@Thorn" class=wikipagelink>Thorn</a>, and perhaps <a href="robowiki@Charo" class=wikipagelink>Charo</a> as we need a random mover(or atleast one that doesn't circle). I still like the idea of having <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a> 3 in there, according to its page it doesn't surf, but its still pretty high in the RR rankings. As for a easy hit bot, so we know if our guns have a major problem, so one of the older bots like <a href="robowiki@Krabby" class=wikipagelink>Krabby</a> and <a href="robowiki@Fractal" class=wikipagelink>Fractal</a>.<br> <br> --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a><br> <br> If we divide up the challenge like the <a href="robowiki@MovementChallenge2K6" class=wikipagelink>MovementChallenge2K6</a>, the number of surfers won't matter. I also agree with having <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a> in there (but shouldn't it be version 2, since version 3 surfs?) so we have a non-orbital mover in there. There's a collection of quite a few old movement experiments on my computer and I could pretty quickly make a <a href="robowiki@MultiMode" class=wikipagelink>MultiMode</a> bot with orbital random movement, go to random movement, sand box flattener movement, the musashi trick, and <a href="robowiki@StopNGo" class=wikipagelink>StopNGo</a> movement if anyone is interested. -- <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a><br> <br> Tron 3 does move at right angles, I did some observing, it might use a surflike technique to not move into danger zones, but isn't really surfing. Version 3 doesn't surf, but Shadow, which is based off tron 3 does. So I personally think tron 3 is okay. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a><br> <br> No, it surfs... Quote from <a href="robowiki@Tron" class=wikipagelink>Tron</a> page:<br> <pre><br> This v3 movement for Tron. Is it WaveSurfing? -- PEZ<br> <br> Yep, no more HeadOnTargeting problem bots...

 I think the problem is that most bots that aren't surfers and aren't random movers are pretty trivial to hit for the top guns. I'd don't want any bot that we can score 99% against. Better yet, 96%. I agree that Tron 2 would be a good choice though. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a><br> <br> Well, as I see it, there are two possible goals for the <a href="robowiki@TargetingChallenge2K7" class=wikipagelink>TargetingChallenge2K7</a>. <br> <br> One, we could try to make it as accurate a benchmark as possible for indicating a gun's overall <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> performance. This would mean it might be no harder than TC2K6, but it would have reference bots that more accurately weighted what goes into a good rumble gun. Based on how the discussion of TC2K6 went last year, I sort of had this goal in mind when we started discussing TC2K7.<br> <br> The other option, IMO, is to make it overall much harder, such as with no 97+ bots and 5 surfers, keeping pace with how much guns have improved over time. This means the old TC's might still be better to use when first tuning a new style of gun, but it would give newer top guns more of a chance to shine (and improve) over time. This definitely has some appeal for me, and I think it could help in pushing the envelope in targeting surfers and top notch random movements, but I'm not sure it would really appeal to everyone. Splitting up the surfer and non-surfer scores in the index would at least help to compensate for this a little...<br> <br> Thoughts?<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> I am speculating here, but if you have a gun that can perform really well against surfers and non-surfer-but-still-hard-to-hit movements, what part of the rumble is left?  More complicated guns take longer to learn, but it is up to your movement to give it the time it needs, no?<br><br> If you wanted to go the TargetingBenchmark2K7 route, I suggest that rather than having top bots, you have bots that have really high specialization indices (which top bots don't have since they pwn most bots evenly).  That would take some participation of the authors.  I don't have any examples off hand, but I suspect that the cx.* bots are in this category.  They are consistent problem bots for me. -- Martin<br> <br> Here is a list of suggestions for a try-out style selection for a hard-to-hit challenge:<br> <ul><br> <li>All try-out entries are submitted by their author, available to download in jar form.<br> <li>All try-out challengers are submitted by their author, available to download in jar form.<br> <li>Any new entry must provide results against all available challengers.<br> <li>Any new challenger must provide results against all available entries.<br> </ul><br> <br> When the ball drops, try-outs are over, and the results are determined as follows:<br> <br> <ol><br> <li>The top 10 challengers (based on average score against all entries in 500 round battles) become the official rating comittee.<br> <li>Entries will be rated in movement challenge style against the rating comittee.<br> <li>The top 10 entry authors will have their best entry as a reference bot in the TC2K7.<br> </ol><br> <br> We could even present the rating comittee as MovementChallenge2K7 reference bots.<br> <br> -- Martin<br> <br> I think the process itself seems fair to the authors of bots, but I'm not sure we'll end up with the kind of diversity we want. Isn't it likely we'd end up with 10 surfers if 10 <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfer" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfer</a> bot authors entered theirs? Not too many active bot authors are working on <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> bots...<br> <br> Funny though, I was about to post Komarious 1.705TC if anyone wants to take a look: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/voidious.mini.Komarious_1.705TC.jar">[voidious.mini.Komarious_1.705TC]</a> ... My current <a href="robowiki@AntiSurfer" class=wikipagelink>AntiSurfer</a> gun (by itself, no <a href="robowiki@VirtualGuns" class=wikipagelink>VirtualGuns</a>) gets about 90 against it.<br> <br> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> They may fall under a general heading of "wave surfer", but I imagine the implementations of <a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>, <a href="robowiki@Corbos" class=wikipagelink>Corbos</a>, <a href="robowiki@DavidAlves" class=wikipagelink>Davis Alves</a>, and <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> are going to behave differently, and guns will perform differently against them.  Meanwhile <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a> may want to resubmit <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a>'s movement, and I plan to submit my randomish grid movement.  My try-out suggestions were geared as I said for a "hard-to-hit" challenge, and the proof is in the pudding, as it were.  If my randomish movement is predictable, or <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> isn't really a hard challenge, should they be in a hard-to-hit targeting challenge?  It is certainly pointless to have 10 clones of the wave surfing tutorial bot, but we won't really know what we'll have until we try it.  If it turns out that the challenge sucks, there's nothing stopping us from saying fuck it and making a new challenge. -- Martin <br> <br> Heh. I'm down to give it a whirl if others are, I guess. I do agree the resulting "committee" could really help in creating MC2K7. I'll probably submit a TC version of <a href="robowiki@Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> that will certainly (hopefully?) outrank <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a><br> <br> This is a cool idea; I'd love to give it a try too. I think we should take the top 5 surfing and the top 5 non surfing entrants and put them in 2 devisions. This will hopefully give a bit more balance to the challenge bots. Even then, I don't think it will be a good representation of the rumble (if that's what your aiming for) because there won't be such a variety in challengers. As more of a challenge in itself, it sounds great to me. -- <a href="robowiki@Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a><br> <br> @<a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a> re:Grishnakh - I was just reading some of the earlier posts in the thread and saw you mentioning Grishnahk as a multi-mode bot, but closed source.  I have source code backups for nearly all of my releases back to v0.0.1.  Grishnakh was compiled from a backup of Ugluk v0.13.0.  I created it as a stand-alone bot because I had done some major overhauls to the foundation of Ugluk's targeting and movement since then.  The multi-mode tuning was geared for a 35 round battle, but with a little tweaking I can adjust it to handle 500 round battles as well.  Still, I fear it would get creamed nearly as badly as Butterfly did.  I suppose it is worth a try though. -- Martin <br> <br> I just checked the results (see below) and I will submit a TC-version of the latest <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGrb" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGrb</a>.

Perhaps we should have a secondary ranking that uses the bots power management.

I glance at the 7 day update listing every morning but .. well I just close the tab.
