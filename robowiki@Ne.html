I've actually been robocoding for years but have never, until just recently, produced a bot that was worth even mentioning. I am by no means an expert and have actually learned quite slowly. My codeing skills are nominal and this stuff confuses the heck out of me to be honest. However, it's also addictively fun.
<p>
<p>
I'm most proud of my <a href="robowiki@StasticalSymbolicPatternMatching" class=wikipagelink>StasticalSymbolicPatternMatching</a>. It's a fairly complex <a href="robowiki@PatternMatcher" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatcher</a> that is somewhat related to <a href="robowiki@SingleTick" class=wikipagelink>SingleTick</a> <a href="robowiki@PatternMatching" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatching</a>. Of everything I've coded into my bots, this seems to be the most effective... pretty much everything else is broken.

<H2>My Bot(s):</H2>

<UL >
<li><a href="robowiki@Chimera" class=wikipagelink>Chimera</a>-<a href="robowiki@MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a>, actually more like a BloatBot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BloatBot" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, and a Melee bot. It uses several different movement and targeting techniques at once instead of one at a time. Also this is my first reasonably competitive bot.

<H2>Aspirations</H2>

<li>Melee bot in the top 100:

<li>I hope to one day create a bot based on the model for consciousness. A bot that not only recognizes it's own existence but the somewhat limited consciousness of all other bots on the field. If I can get it to work, it'll be a crazy combination of statistical symbolic pattern matching, neural networking, and adaptive learning. Obviously, I need to improve my programming skills before attempting such a feat. One's got to have goals.
<li>I want to figure out how to create a pattern matching bot that is capable of grouping bots into different categories based on their movement style and their targeting strategies. Essentially all bots operate on similar premises. I want to create a bot that can recognize that and also find relationships between seemingly unrelated variables and come up with the best strategy to implement against them.

Try editing it all at once, or use the preview button. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

Sorry, still trying to figure all this out. Noticed a few mistakes and typos after I submitted it too. No matter how many times I read and reread, there's always something. Also, my computer seems to enjoy random restarts so if I don't save it often, I'll loose it. In any case, I'll try to keep the edits to a minimum. --<a href="robowiki@Ne" class=wikipagelink>Ne</a>

Please and thankyou, though while most might not display all the edits, I do, so I am all seeing... just not all knowing. :P --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

I certainly don't mind you making lots of edits (I display them all too), but I definitely like it when people fill in that summary field. =) Anyway, welcome to the wiki! -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

Thanks! ^_^, I've actually been lurking around for a good long while... probably the past couple of years. However, I didn't have a bot that wasn't a complete embarrassment until now. That being said, I probably could have developed <a href="robowiki@Chimera" class=wikipagelink>Chimera</a> a ton faster had I actually asked for advice. – <a href="robowiki@Ne" class=wikipagelink>Ne</a>
