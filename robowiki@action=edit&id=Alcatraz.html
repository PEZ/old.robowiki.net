I&#39;m 18, in college, and living in Pennsylvania in the United States. I&#39;ve been following [[Robocode]] for about 4 years.

==== Bots: ====

Competitive Megabot(s):

*[[Cyanide]] - My first WaveSurfing bot and best overall bot; as of October &#39;05 it was #7 in the RR@H.
*[[Immortal]] - My first good bot, it currently features a semi broken WaveSurfing mechanism; best ranking: #13 in the RR@H.
*[[Virgin]] - This bot doesn&#39;t really have a point, it&#39;s neither very original nor very good. As of June &#39;05 it was ranked in the 60s in the RR@H.
*[[Calliope]] - The most downloaded bot on the Repository, though that&#39;s due to a bug. This was my first even relatively competitive bot.

Competitive Minibot(s):

*[[Cyprus]] - A minibot in the 80&#39;s of RR@H as of June &#39;05. It has had various lukewarm reincarnations.

Competitive Nanobot(s):

*[[Freddie]] - The top nanobot by a good margin as of October &#39;05. It switches between two movement types, one that avoids HeadOnTargetting and one that avoids LinearTargetting.
*[[Guppy]] - A very mediocre nanobot that can beat some of the top nanos, but not many of the others.

Competitive Robot(s):

*[[Krazy]] - This is my ExtendsRobot bot. It is the consistent runner up in the ExtendsRobotCompetition that I occasionally run.

Competitive NGBot(s):

*[[CeramicFish]] - My first bot made with the [RobocodeNG/Archive  RobocodeNG] mods. It currently uses the UVLaser and beats all of the SampleBots.

Retired Nanobot(s):

*[[Fury]] - My first nanobot, I gave up on it eventually.
*[[Furious]] - When I started on Fury again, I renamed it Furious.
*[[Mercury]] - A never very good nanobot that changed from a WallRider to a SpinBot to a PicoBot to a HaikuBot and back.
*[[Eddie]] - Was a very good nanobot for awhile, but never won any competitions.

Other Bot(s):

*[[Axraelic]] - Attempts to steal the movement of a top bot, save it, and use it against other bots. Fails.
*[[Azrael]] - Acts differently on every computer, but is consistantly bad.
*[[Vendetta]] - Claim to fame? Was the original name of ms.Ares, the bot which won the beginner level of the official Robocode Rumble.
*[[Vengeance]] - My only bot that attempts to succeed in melee. It doesn&#39;t. 
*[[Sierra]] - A team of spinbots.

==== Comments: ====

I&#39;m happy to see you making yourself visible on the wiki! I almost get tears in my sentimental eyes when I think back on when I started Robocoding and a few months from that and your bot [[Calliope]] was always amongst my test bots. It took quite a while before I could beat it. I think it was when I added VirtualGuns that I finally did it. I still like the agressiveness of that bot and the way it went from oscillating movement to a kind of stop-and-go. It was [[Calliope]] that made me realize that it must be possible to save data between rounds. Do a bit of ego-surfing on the wiki. Use the search function and search for &quot;Calliope&quot; =) -- [[PEZ]]

Always nice to know that a bot of mine was good for something, and that movement especially. Thanks [[PEZ]]. But my fondest memory of good ol&#39; [[Calliope]] would have to be the days that the Repository&#39;s download count for her randomly jumped a thousand or so downloads. Staying on the &#39;Most Popular&#39; list for months was good for the ego too... -- [[Alcatraz]]

=) It was the download count that made me download it in the first place. -- [[PEZ]]

I think it probably has the highest official download count to date.  FloodNano once got a magical 2900 downloads, and I think Cigaret did, too, but FloodNano has since reverted.  Just because it appeared to be a popular bot, though, it&#39;s been downloaded at least twice as much as any of my other bots, through no accomplishment of its own (It&#39;s among the hardest to hit nanos, but I now have the #2 ranked nano, the #1 ranked mini, and the #2 ranked megabot on the ER). -- [[Kawigi]]

I also used [[Calliope]] as one of my test bots; great fun to test against, win or lose. When I first downloaded it, it wasn&#39;t because it had a high download count, but rather because people were talking about it in the forums, although they may have just been talking about it because it had such a high download count :D. Congrats on [[Immortal]] being in the 20s; I&#39;m still out in the 60s with [[Fractal]]... -- [[Vuen]]

What about Guppy, your last (till now) original Robocode bot?  --[[GrubbmGait]]

Oh, right. That one was no good. All I was trying to make was a bot that beat [[Nanis]] and [[Freddie]], and it did, but it lost to far too many other nanos. -- [[Alcatraz]]

Hey! A fellow Pennsylvanian! I hadn&#39;t realized before that there were other people on the wiki from within a few hours of me. --[[wcsv]]

Yeah, I am originally from near Philadelphia but currently out in Pittsburgh. Being here for the Super Bowl was depressing. -- [[Alcatraz]]

Yeah, i saw that your post earlier was from CMU. I tried to get in there, but they didn&#39;t want me. --[[wcsv]]

They&#39;re missing out. This school needs more robocoders. Though I did actually meet someone who had found robocode before, which was a first for me. --[[Alcatraz]]

Question about waves: do you guys fire and/or update waves when the enemy is disabled? -- [[Alcatraz]]

Umm, I just checked, and [[Dookious]]&#39; gun does... *blush* But no, you probably shouldn&#39;t. -- [[Voidious]]
