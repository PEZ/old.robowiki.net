<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext><a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>'s pattern-matching <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a>.  After making <a href="robowiki?FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a>, a nano that's all movement, it was about time to try out everyone's latest hobby of making nanos that are all gun.
<UL >
<li> V. 1.0 - Original version.  Managed to cram in a patternmatcher that projects movement and can handle variable power, a reasonably good movement, and some power management in there.  Codesize is on the edge, 249.
<UL >
<li> Placed 4th in the Semi-pro melee league at the Robocode Outpost, season 7, and was second in bullet damage.
<li> Opened at 48th place on the <a href="robowiki?EternalRumble" class=wikipagelink>EternalRumble</a>, 6/10/2003.  If it weren't for <a href="robowiki?SmallDevil" class=wikipagelink>SmallDevil</a>'s amazing 38-place jump, this would have made it the highest-ranked <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a> in the contest, as it is, it is 2nd, narrowly ahead of <a href="robowiki?NanoLauLectrik" class=wikipagelink>NanoLauLectrik</a>.
<li> Opened the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge at 1st for 1-on-1, winning every single match.  He was #1 for survival and a close #2 for bullet-damage.  I can't say he did it on lucky, easy draws, either, he only faced one opponent who ended with a negative score (-120), and he beat the best Nano Melee bot in the competition, as well as all of the other nano-pattern-matchers, who placed 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 20th out of the 90 robots, and he also beat NanoDuelist<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=NanoDuelist" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and <a href="robowiki?SmallDevil" class=wikipagelink>SmallDevil</a>.  He was also... less than impressive in melee.
<li> Lost one battle to <a href="robowiki?NanoSatan" class=wikipagelink>NanoSatan</a> Kappa in the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge 20030705, and placed 3rd.  Still beat <a href="robowiki?NanoLauLectrik" class=wikipagelink>NanoLauLectrik</a>, SmogSP<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=SmogSP" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, <a href="robowiki?Moebius" class=wikipagelink>Moebius</a> and <a href="robowiki?Kakuru" class=wikipagelink>Kakuru</a>, though.
<li> Destroyed the competition (including <a href="robowiki?Kakuru" class=wikipagelink>Kakuru</a>, <a href="robowiki?NanoSatan" class=wikipagelink>NanoSatan</a> (REVENGE!!), <a href="robowiki?Moebius" class=wikipagelink>Moebius</a>, and both <a href="robowiki?Smog" class=wikipagelink>Smog</a>s) to win the Nano 1-on-1 division, undefeated, by more than 3000 points.  <a href="robowiki?FunkyChicken" class=wikipagelink>FunkyChicken</a> also placed 10th among <a href="robowiki?MicroBots" class=wikipagelink>MicroBots</a>.
</UL>
<li> V. 1.1 - Found some room, tuned the gun a little (now rounds the lateral velocity rather than truncating it for better matching and especially better projection), and introduced a new movement vaguely based on Fhqwhgads' movement.  Should compete with <a href="robowiki?SmallDevil" class=wikipagelink>SmallDevil</a> in the flattest-nano-profile category, and should also be catching up with a few top micros.  Pumped it up in time for the "Final <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge Showdown" (TM).
<UL >
<li> The pump-up was worth it.  It won the nano 1-on-1 division in the last <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge by a large margin (almost 4000 points I think), and then won the Grand Final by a reasonable margin, too (around 2000 points), followed by Vobo, who uses <a href="robowiki?FunkyChicken" class=wikipagelink>FunkyChicken</a>'s gun.
<li> Drops 10 spots to 65 on the ER.  This is really equivalent to going up a couple spots, due to the number of new bots.  It is now 4th among nanos, behind <a href="robowiki?SmallDevil" class=wikipagelink>SmallDevil</a>, TimDog<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=TimDog" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and Avesnar.  Of course, it beat TimDog<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=TimDog" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and Avesnar, and any other nano it randomly came into contact with, which is what it was written for somewhat.
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

I think it can beat any other currently competitive nano at least 40% of the time over 35 rounds (the standard for the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> challenge).  There may be a few exceptions, of course, but I think that they should be very few at least at the moment.  Against some bots it does better over less time, against others it does better over more time.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1512">http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1512</a>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

If you're a nano, watch out.  Otherwise, well, you should at least be able to beat it.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

It's movement, I believe, is completely original, effective, and extremely nano-sized.  I thought of it when I was thinking how a Perceptual bullet dodger(bullet-dodger in the sense that the Flood bots are bullet-dodgers) could be made, by using a function on the enemy's energy that will just happen to change direction when the input value changes by bullet-power amounts.  I'll tease you with that and make you download it to see exactly what I did.  It's so brutally simple you'll hate yourself for not being able to think of a way to hit it.
<p>
Edit: 1.1 is no longer a perceptual bullet-dodger.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

It pattern-matches on lateral velocity, and stores its pattern in a string, much like <a href="robowiki?NanoLauLectrik" class=wikipagelink>NanoLauLectrik</a> does.  The pattern projection logic (yes, it really exists in this one) is unique to nanos I think, except that a version of it may exist in <a href="robowiki?Kakuru" class=wikipagelink>Kakuru</a>, and is logically similar to how <a href="robowiki?Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a> does it.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

By plugging its opponent's energy into a function, it changes direction when its opponent fires a good amount of the time (but not always).
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

It was designed only for <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>OneOnOne</a>, and it looks somewhat like a fool in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>Melee</a>.  But not as much like a fool as some of my recent bots.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

It doesn't really do that.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

It saves the enemy's pattern between rounds, nothing between matches (the nano that saves data between matches is probably the next useless experiment).
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

Have you ever been sitting there, about to start a new robot, and just have no idea what to call it?
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Oh, if you insist.  I changed enough of the code related to the concepts I borrowed from other bots that I almost considered not releasing the source, at least not yet, because I wanted to keep the stupidly simple movement algorithm to myself.  But I'm too nice for that, and it does end up looking a little like the other pattern-matching nanos.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Eh, don't know.  If I thought I could put it in there, maybe wall avoidance.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

Hmmm... has problems most often with <a href="robowiki?FurryLeech" class=wikipagelink>FurryLeech</a> and <a href="robowiki?FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a> out of any <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a>s (the second of which I'm not complaining about, really).
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

It has a little logic borrowed from <a href="robowiki?NanoLauLectrik" class=wikipagelink>NanoLauLectrik</a>, <a href="robowiki?Kakuru" class=wikipagelink>Kakuru</a>, <a href="robowiki?FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a>, and <a href="robowiki?Teancum" class=wikipagelink>Teancum</a>, each in little bits (of course, nanos only have little bits).

Definitely looks like a top 3 nano. -- <a href="robowiki?Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>

What can I say? This is a really funky chicken. =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Kawigi, why exactly is 
<pre>
	static String pattern = "" + (char)0 + (char)1 +......
</pre>
coded the way it is?
<p>
Lol, actually, I got that from the dev version of Moebius.  I think it was <a href="robowiki?Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a> who discovered you can make an assignment of whatever length string literal with a cost of something like 2 bytes, so rather than having to add a check if we even have a match at all, we'll always have at least a match of length 1, because all valid characters are somewhere in the string in the beginning.  Of course, it might not be that great of a guess.  The string doesn't end up looking like "012345", etc, however, those first 16 characters are mostly special characters, so that's why I take their integer counterparts and cast them as characters. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Big congrats on the <a href="robowiki?MiniBotChallenge" class=wikipagelink>MiniBotChallenge</a> results! This is one strong nano. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
