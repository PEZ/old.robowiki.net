Ant

Actually two versions of it are discussed here.

zyx.nano.Ant

zyx.micro.Ant

==== Author ====
[[zyx]]

==== Extends ====
[[AdvancedRobot]]

==== What&#39;s special about it? ====
Nothing, just a small [[NanoBot|nano]] and [[MicroBot|micro]] bot.

==== Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it? ====
nano: https://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=3480

micro: https://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=3481

==== How competitive is it? ====
Just started in the rumble, I will expand this later.

But I think the nano version will be fairly good in the [[Melee]] nano rumble.

And the micro version should be somewhat competitive in the micro [[OneOnOne]] rumble.

==== How does it [[Movement|move]]? ====
[[StopAndGo]], I don&#39;t really know who invented it, or who made it common, but thanks to them anyway. I read a little bit about it on the wiki, and then made it myself.

The nano version switches to a circular movement sometimes.

==== How does it fire? ====
nano: Assumes circular movement around him, so fires at factor 1 always.

micro: [[GuessFactorTargeting]] with little segmentation on distance, only considers close and far. Inverse exponential [[BinSmoothing]], like the one found in the [[WaveSurfing/Turotial|WaveSurfing Tutorial]].

==== How does it [[DodgingBullets|dodge bullets]]? ====
[[StopAndGo]]

==== How does the [[Melee|melee]] strategy differ from [[OneOnOne|one-on-one]]  strategy? ====
The nano version switches to [[CircularMovement]] sometimes on [[OneOnOne|one-on-one]]. But in [[Melee|melee]] it alwasys uses [[CircularMovement]] since it is really hard to know a bullet was fired in a nano melee bot.

==== How does it select a target to attack/avoid in [[Melee|melee]]? ====
Both Lock their radars on the first bot they scan.

The nano version spins it&#39;s radar every time a robot dies, this makes him search for new robots if his target dies, and hardly makes him lose it if the robot that died is a different one because it locks again at sight.

The micro version can handle this in the run method, so no fancy trick here.

==== What does it save between rounds and matches? ===
The micro version uses static data for the [[GuessFactor]]s.

Neither saves anything between matches.

==== Where did you get the name? ====
Since the nano version was the first one, I just thought of something that was little but could do some harm. And an ant bit me last weekend, and it was kind of hurting me.

==== Can I use your code? ====
Both jar files have the code inside, use it but give appropriate credits if something gets your attention.

==== What&#39;s next for your robot? ====
Not sure yet, I&#39;ll wait for them to have a more stable place in the rumble before.

==== Does it have any [[WhiteWhale]]s? ====
I&#39;m pretty sure they do.

==== What other robot(s) is it based on? ====
The micro version is based on the nano version.
