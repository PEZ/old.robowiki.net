Just creating this page because I think it can be done =) Best rating for a <a href="robowiki@Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> that I can find is 2.2c at 2076... Not 100% sure if that's the highest, though. According to <a href="robowiki@Pugilist/LatestUpdates" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist/LatestUpdates</a>, that version has 50 bytes free, too! <em>Edit: It has 55 bytes free at size 1444.</em> -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Oh, now you're being too modest.  Though I don't have the screen shot to prove it, the version of <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> that was in the rumble when I joined the Mini league was over 2100.  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
Yeah, but it hadn't faced everyone yet :-\ ... When I made that comment, <a href="robowiki@Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> was still the king, as it was for a very long time. My best version in the <a href="robowiki@MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> ranking is Komarious 1.712, which is about 2090. I do have about 20 bytes to play with in that version (if you subtract the colors), but it's mighty tough to find 10 points in 20 bytes! ;) -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Yah, but we all know you'll do it in 3. ;) --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
You'd better hurry, Voidious.  You may have about until until tomorrow morning before my latest release gets up to 1,000 battles :).  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
First off, it's unlikely I can do that, but maybe I'll try. =) Second - wow! Comparisons with 1.7 show that this one has a definite chance at 2100. I look forward to seeing where it ends up. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
2102.16 at 552 battles, I think you might actually make it! --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Onlly 40 opponents you haven't faced yet - I really think you got it. =) (*Knocks on some wood.*) Looking forward to finding out for sure. I really got no inspiration for <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> right now, despite the free space, but I'll try to join you here sometime... -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Uhhhhhh .... I don't know.  That score is on the downswing right now.  It's gonna be close.  As soon as it makes it over the threshhold, I'll update my version history, then you can join me within a couple hours, Voidious :).  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
Ok, Voidious, the door is still open.  My version history tells you exactly what you can do to pick up about 16 points, if <a href="robowiki@WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> is any indication.  The source is available in the repository, as well.  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
The obstacle to doing this in <a href="robowiki@Komarious" class=wikipagelink>Komarious</a> is I assume a bullet hit is the oldest wave - I don't have any code for finding the "closest" wave to whatever collision point. But I might be able to fit the necessary changes after the space you freed for me. :) I'm also a bit shy about using the Rules.* class, just because it's new and other bots like <a href="robowiki@Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> never had access to it. But I may need that extra space if onBulletHitBullet<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BulletHitBullet" class=wikipageedit>?</a> is indeed so useful. I'll do some tinkering soonish... -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Think you can do it in the time it takes me to run 300 more battles (+ however many of the general rumble run in the mean time)?  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>
<p>
Hehe - "could", maybe maybe, but almost surely "won't". =) Sorry not be better competition for this "race", but I just feel more like enjoying the weekend than slaving over Komarious right now. You can trust that I have definitely posted many many versions trying to improve on 1.712, though, as I'm sure you've already seen yourself. =) -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Really really great job, man, congratulations! <a href="robowiki@WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> has really raised the bar in the <a href="robowiki@MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> class. I promise I'll try and give you some competition in the semi-near future. :-P  I added a screenshot (and fixed the date). So, what's next for you now? <a href="robowiki@TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> maybe? General class <a href="robowiki@The2100Club" class=wikipagelink>2100 club</a>? -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Thank you, thank you.  It's hard to say what's next.  I have an idea I think might improve my pattern matching, and it would definitely only be for the general rumble category.  I also have a very small start to what I'm hoping would be a much faster implementation than using strings.  However, I did recieve an offer from a guy to buy my laptop last night, which I now plan to sell him, so my time may be a bit limited.  All along during this addiction I've thought I would be better off without it.  I mean, maybe if I could control myself a bit more.  You know, just spend some time on it every once in a while ...  -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>

<li>You want to regulate your robocoding time? Get a wife, get kids, get a job 160 km from home, make sure your wife works irregular hours and voila, you will have max 3 times half an hour per week left for robocoding. Congratulations b.t.w, it must be really satisfying that your ideas are that successfull.  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<li>Hmm ... I'll have to think about that.  I mean, it seems like a reasonable solution ... ;)  Thanks for the congrats. -- <a href="robowiki@Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>

Congratz, your really breaking the limits here, <a href="robowiki@WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> already took the crown and now it breaks into the 2100<a href="robowiki@The2100Club/Mini" class=wikipagelink>/Mini</a> club too. Way to go! <a href="robowiki@WeeksOnEnd" class=wikipagelink>WeeksOnEnd</a> is really an amazing bot (if memory munchy). Watchout Voidious, Simonton already took the crowns for Nano, Micro and Mini, there is only a single <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>OneOnOne</a> division left to go. ;) --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Due to the beauty of Ratings Drift, Komarious is now a proud member. If you're watching the wiki, Voidious, you might want to add it =) -- <a href="robowiki@Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
