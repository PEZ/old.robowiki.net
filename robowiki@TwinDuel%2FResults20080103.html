Still a bit too close for comfort, but nice to see <a href="robowiki?LuminariousDuo" class=wikipagelink>LuminariousDuo</a> back on top. =) Good games, all!
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Something very strange happened to <a href="robowiki?NightAndDay" class=wikipagelink>NightAndDay</a>....I'll have to check the jar when I get home tomorrow...but could you at least verify that it's putting 2 bots on the field? Thanks...-- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
I loaded up <a href="robowiki?NightAndDay" class=wikipagelink>NightAndDay</a> 1.3 in that install of Robocode to make sure it ran OK and didn't throw any errors. Beyond that, I'm really not sure what's going on =( What kind of results do you get? I'm using Robocode 1.1.3 still (as it will take some work to update the automation script for newer Robocodes), but that shouldn't be an issue unless you're using the Rules class (which is one reason I double checked that it ran). -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
The reason I'm surprised is that my dev version (which I *think* I uploaded as 1.3) beats everybody except <a href="robowiki?LuminariousDuo" class=wikipagelink>LuminariousDuo</a>, <a href="robowiki?MarioBros" class=wikipagelink>MarioBros</a>, and sometimes <a href="robowiki?KomariousTeam" class=wikipagelink>KomariousTeam</a> (just bad luck). It beats <a href="robowiki?GeminiTeam" class=wikipagelink>GeminiTeam</a> and <a href="robowiki?GrauwuarG" class=wikipagelink>GrauwuarG</a> about 50-25, and <a href="robowiki?YinYang" class=wikipagelink>YinYang</a> about 57-18. Which is why I was surprised =). I'll double check when I get home =) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
Doh! I have done stuff like that. Hope you can figure out what's up, as I was really looking forward to having a new contender. =) 
<p>
@Chase-san: By the way, it looks like my system totally choked on having two versions of the same team in there. I will fix the code to handle it nicely (if it's not too big a pain), but I'd really prefer not to have two of the same team, anyway. For this case, they looked like different teams with the same name, so I was OK with it, but I think you might as well give them different names if you're going to enter two different teams. Also, please e-mail them to me, as it was only dumb luck that I happened to look at the Participants page this week.
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
They we're just concept teams, I didn't want to make two different bots for something that won't actually make production, 1.0 that was done here was a <a href="robowiki?TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> rammer, and the other version 1.2 was a <a href="robowiki?TwinDuel" class=wikipagelink>TwinDuel</a> Mirror Bot, both very cheap tactics, they boths used a nano linear targeting gun, i'll make up something better for next week though, I have been watching the way <a href="robowiki?DoctorBob" class=wikipagelink>DoctorBob</a> moves recently... --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
I've discovered what the problem is. In Java 1.5 Point2D.Double does NOT implement Serializable, whereas in Java 1.6 it DOES. Because I do my message-sending in a try/catch it didn't disable my bot. This resulted in my bot not aware (at all) that it's teammate even existed. I'll try and figure something out. -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
You could have a class extend Point2D.Double and have it implement Serializable, it would ahve exactly the same effect and only take a few bytes. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Hey, I just came up with exactly that idea! Great minds think alike =) -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> It seems that didn't work quite as well as I thought it would....so I just added a container class with x and y that implements serializable. All fixed! So there will be a serious threat from <a href="robowiki?NightAndDay" class=wikipagelink>NightAndDay</a> next week! -- <a href="robowiki?Skilgannon" class=wikipagelink>Skilgannon</a>
<li> Ah, cool that you found it. I'm surprised you were able to compile with 1.5 compatibility with that issue in there...? Anyway, the serializable location class with x/y is exactly what I do, too, for the same reason. Looking forward to next week =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
