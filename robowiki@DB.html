<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Hello, I'm a begginer.
Well, I do have a little experience in C#, but barely any in java.
<p>
<p>
Welcome to the wiki! Don't worry about being a beginner at java, <a href="robowiki?Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a> is a great way to motivate yourself to learn more about it(at least for me anyway). --<a href="robowiki?Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
Welcome, It is indeed a fun way to learn java. But be carefull it can be very addictive ;-). -- <a href="robowiki?Florent" class=wikipagelink>Florent</a>
<p>
Welcome, just take your time to follow the discussions and read backgroundinfo. Don't be intimidated by the topbots, everybody has started once with a derivate of a samplebot.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
Thanks for the welcome. I actually started programming with java but quickly switched over to C# because it is VERY similar, just a bit more powerfull.
I would realy enjoy it if somehow you could get all the cool stuff from VisualStudio<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=VisualStudio" class=wikipageedit>?</a> into the robocode compiler (stuff like intelisense, more descriptive compiler errors, etc.) it would really make me do a lot more robocode.
The reason that I'm doing programming at all is because I have an Extreme programming geek as a older brother.
<p>
Though I work in a C# development shop, I'd be careful to color it as 'more powerful' :). If you're looking for a better IDE, you might want to check <a href="robowiki?Eclipse" class=wikipagelink>Eclipse</a> and <a href="robowiki?Eclipse/Setup" class=wikipagelink>Eclipse/Setup</a>. It's free and has a million great features like intellisense and jump-to compiler errors. With the right plug-in, it even compiles C#. Welcome to the wiki! --<a href="robowiki?Corbos" class=wikipagelink>Corbos</a>
<p>
Thanks! I'm downloading Eclipse right now. By the way, I'm trying to upload my three bots that I've made so that you can take a look at them. Would anyone care to explane how to do that?
<p>
Check out the <a href="robowiki?RobocodeRepository" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeRepository</a>, they let you post and upload tanks there. Welcome to the wiki! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
OK, I found a way to show you the source codes <a href="robowiki?DB's_Robots" class=wikipagelink>DB's Robots</a>.
<p>
(Edit Conflict) ... Well, to post information about your bot, you can use the <a href="robowiki?TemplateForBotPages" class=wikipagelink>TemplateForBotPages</a>, and make a page for your bot... just go the URL like YourBotName<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=YourBotName" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, and "Edit" that page, and it will be created. Then you can link to that from the <a href="robowiki?Bots" class=wikipagelink>Bots</a> pages, like <a href="robowiki?Bots/A" class=wikipagelink>Bots/A</a>. However, none of that includes the actual file that contains your bot - you have to use your own web space or the <a href="robowiki?RobocodeRepository" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeRepository</a> for that. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Thank you for the suggestion but I prefer for right now to just have a temporary link to <a href="robowiki?DB's_Robots" class=wikipagelink>DB's Robots</a>.
Please check them out and give me some suggestions. I'll put them in the robots section Hi<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=HiStuff" class=wikipageedit>?</a> <a href="robowiki?Xhehdy" class=wikipagelink>Xhehdy</a> <a href="robowiki?Die" class=wikipagelink>Die</a> <a href="robowiki?Rebot" class=wikipagelink>Rebot</a>
<p>
Welcome, DB. I have a few suggestions for you.
<p>
1. I would suggest following the usual pattern here of putting robot descriptions and discussion in pages with the robot's name - like I do with <a href="robowiki?Strength" class=wikipagelink>Strength</a>. Then you can put the code in a page like RobotName/Code<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=RobotName/Code" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. This makes it easier for others to find your robots' pages.
2. I would suggest using someone else's code to create a radar lock - it's fairly standard code anyway. That way, you can focus on movement and targeting.
3. For targeting, I would turn the gun using turnGunRight<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=GunRight" class=wikipageedit>?</a> or turnGunLeft<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=GunLeft" class=wikipageedit>?</a> rather than the robot using turnLeft or turnRight.
4. I would extend <a href="robowiki?AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a> with robots rather than Robot - this will give you much more flexibility.
5. Use some simple targeting pages for ideas for better targeting to get started, like <a href="robowiki?HeadOnTargeting" class=wikipagelink>HeadOnTargeting</a>.
<p>
Good luck!

<p>
This may be suprising but I just figgured out how to make my robots do multiple things at once. I am now ditching all thoughts of improving all my past 4 robots, I'm starting over!
Thanks <a href="robowiki?Kev" class=wikipagelink>Kev</a> for the info.

<p>
While making a new robot I got frusterated that the second time I would call set<a href="robowiki?TurnGunRight" class=wikipagelink>TurnGunRight</a>(e.getBearing()); the gun went some random direction.
But I fixed that problem by making a few new getBearing methoods you can check them out and use them <a href="robowiki?New_getBearing()_methoods" class=wikipagelink>here</a>
<p>
Please note that the setxxx commands are NOT a stack, just single values for each component (tank, turret, radar). If you do a second setxxx command, the first one is overwritten and only the second is executed after you finished your turn. You probably already found the pages, but you can check out <a href="robowiki?GamePhysics" class=wikipagelink>GamePhysics</a> and <a href="robowiki?BeginnersFAQ" class=wikipagelink>BeginnersFAQ</a> to understand how the game reacts on your commands. PS: if you put some code on the wiki, use the  &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;  tags, it makes it better readable.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>

When was consciousness check thing put in for editing pages?
It is certainly a very good idea!...especialy after May 19(check the changes page).
<p>
I took a look at the Project Ant Hill by Jabe2022, and it gave me an idea for another teams project.
If I make it there would be the leader which would have a few bodyguards around it and the rest would be on the offensive side. When a robot dies the remaining robots would switch jobs accordingly to keep a specified balance(eg. if the balance is 40% bodyguards 10% leaders and 50% attackers and the leader died, then someone would take its place)
<p>
A lot of changes have taken place with me (Darrel). One is that I have found architecture as a much more enjoyable feild for me. Another is that we got some new computers and the one that atomatically logged me in on here is no longer in use(thus, the lack of a user name). The Tool that I'm using for architecture is Sketchup, a 3D modeling program created by Google. The project that I mentioned in the last post(a very long time ago) was never started, instead my older brother(not the programmer) showed me sketchup and the project was quickly forgoten. Curently my older brother (this time the programer) is doing a proggraming internship at Boing, the other brother is going to Indiana this summer for a several-week piano-camp kind of thing that only the top 20 piano students entering(from across the nation)get to enter. I'll every so often check here to see if you're trying to contact me, otherwise... Goodby.
