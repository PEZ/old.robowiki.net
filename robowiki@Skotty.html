<p>
<p>I learned of Robocode surprisingly late in the game, considering that I'm a Java developer and loved earlier similar games like C-Robots.  I first learned of Robocode in September of 2006, thanks to someone else where I work.  Since then most of my efforts have been in learning the game and developing my first robot, Athena.  Although I may eventually write other robots, at present time my only other robots are very simple test bots.</p>
<p>
<p>I'm not currently releasing my robot for general destruction, or to compete in public competitions.  I'm planning on waiting until after the competition at work, plus there are a number of areas that I still need to work on.  I also need more time to collect robots to test against.  I have had chronic problems attempting to access and download robots from the robocode repository website.  To date, I've only been able to download a small handful of other robots.  If anyone knows of an alternative source to obtain robots from, please let me know!</p>
<p>
<h3>Rihan</h3>
<p>
<p>Rihan takes all I've learned from Athena, throws out everything that didn't work, cleans up everything that did work, and includes new ideas that *might* work.  It's a very tough job being new to Robocode and trying to develop a competitive bot without examining or using other people's code.  However, I have confidence that Rihan will make a decent showing.</p>
<p>
<p>When I refer to statistical targeting and movement, I'm refering to my custom algorithms that use statistics as a base.  It's likely very similar to Wave Surfing and Guess Factor Targeting from what I've read.  For Rihan, the statistical algorithms are completetly re-written.</p>
<p>
<p>At present, the statistical algorithms are still under development, and the melee movement needs to be written as well.  My target date for completion is 1/15/2007.</p>
<p>
<p><b>Update:</b>It's been a long time...I became frustrated and moved on to other things for over a year, but now I'm playing around with Robocode again.  One of the reasons for my frustration is that, despite my best efforts at the time, I was unable to write a Wave Surfing module superior to simple random drive, my Guess Factor Targeting really wasn't any better than just having Linear and Circular targeting, and I began to feel as though everything I was interested in doing with Robocode would end up being disadvantages for whatever bot I built.  May not be true, but for example, I can't help but think that small compressed highly-efficient bots will be superior to the modular object-oriented bots I want to write.  I've also started to wonder if the superior targeting algorithms are one that just use some kind of refined guessing as to the actual mathematical calculations I was trying to do (even "simple" linear targeting turns out to be quite complex if done as a single no-guess no-simulation algorithm).
<p>
Nevertheless, I'm back again...sort of.  For the moment, I feel like playing with Robocode bots again.  Rihan is no match for the advanced bots out there, but is still a pretty decent bot.  I suppose I should clean up the code and post it as open source in case anyone wants to look at it.  I wrote it entirely myself.

<h3>Athena</h3>
<p>
<p>Athena was initially developed for a small competition at work.  Because I enjoy trying to write everything myself, and because it was a requirement for the competition, all of my code is written by me, without examining nor using existing code from others, though I have garnered a few ideas from reading through some informational pages here and there.</p>

There is a zip containing almost all of the robots entered in the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>. There is a link to it on <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble</a> and welcome to the <a href="robowiki@RoboWiki" class=wikipagelink>RoboWiki</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<p>
Thank you for pointing that out, Kinsen.  Much appreciated. -- Skotty

I am pretty much done with Athena in it's current version.  Athena is big, sloppy in parts, and I think a few things need to be rewritten completely.  I would say it's a relatively mediocre robot from the few tests I've run against other non-sample bots.  I am starting a re-write now, but I haven't decided whether this will be a new robot or just another version of Athena.  -- Skotty (12/18/2006)
<p>
I do alot of rewrites myself, I want to constantly build new bots, as almost all my tuning attempts always make it worse then the original version. --<a href="robowiki@Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Same experiences. Just keep your original code for every version, restore if necessary, and if you start like me, with megabots, you will have a hard time squeezing your code later. I am not discouraging, but just recommending you start from smaller ones, or maybe a minibot, and welcome to the Wiki. -- <a href="robowiki@Aryary" class=wikipagelink>Aryary</a>
