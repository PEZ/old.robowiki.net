<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Newest events first:
<UL >
<li> Jan 29 2006 - Version 2.3 released - <strong>? points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement - Old <a href="robowiki@Wave" class=wikipagelink>Wave</a> handling restored. No "artificial" wall-bouncing (yeah, I've tried that like 1000 times, but now it's time again).
<li> 82 bytes free
</UL>
<li> Jan 28 2006 - Version 2.2d released - <strong>1978 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement - Another test with simplified wave handling
<li> 60 bytes free
</UL>
<li> Jan 27 2006 - Version 2.2c released - <strong>1988 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement - Old <a href="robowiki@Wave" class=wikipagelink>Wave</a> handling restored, still no stop-position evaluation
<li> 50 bytes free
</UL>
<li> Jan 27 2006 - Version 2.2b released - <strong>1978 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement - No stop-position evaluation and a lot of simplifications in <a href="robowiki@Wave" class=wikipagelink>Wave</a> handling
<li> 82 bytes free
</UL>
<li> Jan 26 2006 - Version 2.2 released - <strong>1991 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement - Now evaluates stop-position in surfing. Wave danger not vanishing as fast with distance from Pugilist. (If these changes don't give me a rating boost I'll scrap them and use the saved 70 bytes I just found for something else.)
</UL>
<li> Nov 24 2004 - Version 2.1.2 released - <strong>1987 points</strong> and 100% wins in the <a href="robowiki@PremierLeague" class=wikipagelink>PremierLeague</a>

</UL>
<li> Sep 2 2004 - Version 2.0.9 released - <strong>1997 points</strong>

</UL>
<li> Sep 1 2004 - Version 2.0.8b released - <strong>1967 points</strong> (Really, really strange. I think P has a big bug somewhere that shows itself very seldomly and this version had more bad luck than most of the others.)

<UL >
<li> Removed the last gun change since I obviously couldn't afford the effects of the new movement wave management.
<li> 45 bins for movement and gun waves
<li> Goes easier on the gun wall segmentation
<li> More precise factor-to-bin-and-back translation for the gun waves.

<li> Gun tweak from <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>'s suggestion. (Let's hope the enemy wave management change doesn't bite me...)
</UL>
<li> May 23 2004 - Version 1.9.9.4.1 released - <strong>2008 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 1.9.9.4 movement and 1.9.9.8.1 gun tweak (Same gun as used in <a href="robowiki@SilverFist" class=wikipagelink>SilverFist</a> and .p versions of <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> and <a href="robowiki@RaikoMX" class=wikipagelink>RaikoMX</a>.)
</UL>
<li> (Deferred) - Version 2.0 released (will be) - <strong>? points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Finally a true <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfer" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfer</a>. No wall bouncing ever, ever. Zero bytes left though...
</UL>
<li> May 23 2004 - Version 1.9.9.8.2 released - <strong>1977 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to gun wall segmentof 1.9.9.4 (checking if my "improved" wall smoothing algo might be losing me points.)
</UL>
<li> May 22 2004 - Version 1.9.9.8.1 released - <strong>1986 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Gun wall segment tweak in between 1.9.9.4 and 1.9.9.7
<li> Wall smoothing change. No more wall avoidance problems I hope.

<UL >
<li> Gun wall segmentation tweak.
</UL>

<UL >
<li> Gun segmentation tweaks.
</UL>

</UL>
<li> May 18 2004 - Version 1.9.7.6 released - <strong>1976 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Should be functionally equivalent to 1.9.7. Only slightly refactored to save me 19 bytes.
<li> Like 1.9.7 but with a combined last_velocity and wall segment dimension.
</UL>
<li> May 18 2004 - Version 1.9.7.5 released - <strong>1969 points</strong> (Either I introduced a but in the segmentation or I just can't afford the slower learning...)
<UL >
<li> Like 1.9.7 but with a combined last_velocity and wall segment dimension.

</UL>
<li> May 17 2004 - Version 1.9.8 released - <strong>1975 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Lots of tweaks and changes everywhere... I might revisit them later since some of them probably was better than others.
</UL>
<li> May 17 2004 - Version 1.9.7 released - <strong>1992 points</strong> (Strongest yet, and it seems to have taken a firm hold on the minibot ranking #1 slot.)
<UL >
<li> Recalled surfing tuning of 1.9.6
<li> Tuned wall smoothing
<li> Back to using calculated max_escape_angle
</UL>

</UL>
<li> May 16 2004 - Version 1.9.4.5b released - <strong>1972 points</strong>
<UL >

</UL>
<li> May 16 2004 - Version 1.9.4.5 released - <strong>1979 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Segmenting on both last_velocity and wall (and distance and velocity too of course).
<li> Has a bug where fast learning (unsegmented) stats atre weighted too high.
</UL>
<li> May 15 2004 - Version 1.9.5 released - <strong>1980 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Applied some simple edge protection. Not a good idea it seems.
</UL>
<li> May 15 2004 - Version 1.9.4.4 released - <strong>1987 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Replaced last_velocity segment with wall segment
<li> Not caluclating max_escape_angle, just using 1.0. (Saves bytes, and shouldn't make a difference anyway.)
</UL>

<UL >
<li> Replaced movement wall segmentation with last_last_velocity and last_velocity
<li> Weight fast-learning stats by 1/num_segment_combinations like <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a> has suggested.

<li> Fixed surfing bug
</UL>
<li> May 14 2004 - Version 1.9.3.4 released - <strong>1966 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> One more distance segmentation bin and fewer of most other segmentation bins. Meant to speed up learning.
</UL>
<li> May 14 2004 - Version 1.9.3.3 released - <strong>1977 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Wall-bouncing at close ranges. Suggested by <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>.
</UL>
<li> May 13 2004 - Version 1.9.3.2 released - <strong>1958 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Using a rough estimate of the length of my <a href="robowiki@WallSmoothing" class=wikipagelink>WallSmoothing</a> blind-mans-stick instead of a calculated one. Saves bytes and makes for a less stubborn behaviour when fighting at point blank range.
</UL>
<li> May 12 2004 - Version 1.9.3.1 released - <strong>1923 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Yet another try with pure surfing. (That is, no wall bouncing and such).
</UL>
<li> May 11 2004 - Version 1.6.4.30b released - <strong>1982 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Small gun tweak from 1.6.4.4
</UL>
<li> May 7 2004 - Version 1.6.4.17 released - <strong>1940 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 37 enemy wave stat bins
<li> Smoothing with Math.pow(distance, 1.5)
<li> Edge protection with <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>'s idea of an inverted smoothed flat curve. (Adaption of <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>'s implementation as posted on the <a href="robowiki@SilverSurfer" class=wikipagelink>SilverSurfer</a> page.)
</UL>
</UL>
<strike>
<UL >
<li> May 7 2004 - Version 1.6.4.16 released - <strong>? points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 37 enemy wave stat bins
<li> Smoothing with Math.pow(distance, 1.5) (like <a href="robowiki@SilverSurfer" class=wikipagelink>SilverSurfer</a>, though with much fewer bins)
</UL>
<li> May 7 2004 - Version 1.6.4.15 released - <strong>1929 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 17 enemy wave stat bins
<li> Gravitational smoothing
<li> (Yeah, like <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>)
</UL>
</UL>
</strike>
<UL >
<li> May 7 2004 - Version 1.6.4.14 released - <strong>1959 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 15 enemy wave stat bins
<li> No smoothing
</UL>
<li> May 7 2004 - Version 1.6.4.13 released - <strong>1955 points</strong>
<UL >

</UL>
<li> May 6 2004 - Version 1.6.4.10 released - <strong>1973 points</strong>

<li> Same as 1.6.4.9 but with:
<UL >
<li> Edge smoothing protection
<li> Smoothed gun stats
<li> 47 stat bins (instead of 27) for both gun and movement
</UL>
</UL>
<li> May 5 2004 - Version 1.9 released - <strong>1914 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movement:
<UL >
<li> Linear bin smoothing
<li> Edge smoothing protection
<li> Iterated <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> impact points
<li> Absolutely no wall bouncing! Pure <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> this time.
</UL>
<li> Gun:
<UL >
<li> Bin smoothing (with edge protection)
</UL>
</UL>
<li> May 5 2004 - Version 1.6.4.9 released - <strong>1973 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Like 1.6.4.4 with linear distance smoothing. (Saves some bytes!)
</UL>
<li> May 5 2004 - Version 1.6.4.8 released - <strong>1967 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Like 1.6.4.4 with gravitational smoothing.
</UL>
<li> May 4 2004 - Version 1.7.7 released - <strong>1951 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Movemenet: Fast learning stats again, with low weights. And gravitational bin smoothing by suggestions from <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
</UL>
<li> May 4 2004 - Version 1.6.4.7 released - <strong>1952 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Now weighting the stats based on enemy wave distance. Still no smoothing.
</UL>
<li> May 4 2004 - Version 1.6.4.6 released - <strong>1944 points</strong> (or there about, I recalled this version before it got 500 battles under its belt).
<UL >
<li> Trying without smoothing the <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> stats (not even weighting it for distance).
</UL>
<li> May 4 2004 - Version 1.7.6 released - <strong>1947 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 1.6.4.4 With fast-learning applied. (Or, I tried to apply it. I think I might be doing it the wrong way.)
</UL>
<li> May 3 2004 - Version 1.6.4.5b released - <strong>1975 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 1.6.4.4 with saved gun-data on some 30 opponents (couldn't fit more since the gun is heavily segmented). Obviously this data didn't make any difference at all.
</UL>
<li> May 2 2004 - Version 1.6.4.4 released - <strong>1975 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> 1.6.4 with 39 bytes free and some really minor tunings.
</UL>
<li> May 1 2004 - Version 1.6.4.2 released - <strong>1951 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Lower granularity in the time-since-deccel and wall gun segments.
</UL>
<li> May 1 2004 - Version 1.6.4.1 released - <strong>1954 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to the 1.6.4 track. Now with a gun tuning added.
</UL>
<li> April 30 2004 - Version 1.8.1 released - <strong>1958 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Trying to predict the <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> impact locations via iteration rather than the crude estimate I had before. Should make things much more accurate near walls. Though I don't know how to account for decceleration time this way yet...
</UL>
<li> April 30 2004 - Version 1.6.7 released - <strong>1973 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> This is the same as 1.6.4 except I try to protect the edge smoothing a tad more.
</UL>
<li> April 29 2004 - Version 1.7.2 released - <strong>1962 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Since I'm desperate I decided to try with smoothed gun GFs as well. It only costs me 1 byte anyway so any rating points gained will be quite cheap. (Even if it is very unlikely I'll gain any points at all.)
</UL>
<li> April 29 2004 - Version 1.7.1 released - <strong>1967 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> With both fast-learning mode and edge-smoothing protection activated.
<li> <em>Strong but doesn't collect as much points as 1.6.4. Now it's something like a cross road for me where to take P...</em>
</UL>
<li> April 29 2004 - Version 1.6.6 released - <strong>1963 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to using only lightly segmented <a href="robowiki@EnemyWaves" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWaves</a>
<li> Trying without dealing with the edge smoothing problem. (If this doesn't give less point I'd say there is no "edge smoothing problem".)
<UL >
<li> -10 points. I guess there really exist such a beast as the "edge-smoothing problem". Since I removed edge-smoothing protection in 1.7 this probably means that 1.7.1 (with fast-learning mode and edge-smoothing protection) should give me 1980+ points. I just must find 10 or so bytes somewhere...
</UL>
</UL>
<li> April 28 2004 - Version 1.7 released - <strong>1969 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Now uses unsegmented <a href="robowiki@EnemyWaves" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWaves</a> when there's no data in the segmented one.
<li> Starved on bytes agains. Only 2 left!
</UL>
<li> April 28 2004 - Version 1.6.5 released - <strong>1973 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Gun tuning (narrowed down the GF +/- 1 boundaries).
</UL>
<li> April 28 2004 - Version 1.6.4 released - <strong>1976 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to 1.5.6.2 <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> segmentations (distance and fire power)
<li> Gun wall segment tweak.
</UL>
<li> April 27 2004 - Version 1.6.3 released - <strong>1959 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> segmentation on distance, bullet power, velocity. Rough segments with few buckets.
<li> Doesn't win or lose one single rating point compared to unsegmented waves...
</UL>
<li> April 27 2004 - Version 1.6.2 released - <strong>1959 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Trashed the new gun segmentation. Makes me lose bigger against <a href="robowiki@Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>'s bots. But with that segmentation I obviously lost some against the rest making the end sum -4 or so points.
<li> Now trying totally unsegmented <a href="robowiki@EnemyWaves" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWaves</a>.
</UL>
<li> April 26 2004 - Version 1.6 released - <strong>1959 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Threw in yet another segmentation for the gun. One which I don't think many <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfers" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfers</a> are using. Now I have exactly zero bytes left in this bot. Let's hope this segmentation doesn't work. =)
</UL>
<li> April 26 2004 - Version 1.5.6.2 released - <strong>1963 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Gun tweaks
</UL>
<li> April 22 2004 - Version 1.5.6 released - <strong>1932 points</strong>
<UL >

<li> Increased the granularity of wall segmentation in the gun Waves.
</UL>
<li> April 22 2004 - Version 1.5.4.1 released - <strong>1930 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Fixed bug with array index out of bounds at extreme distances. Thanks to <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> for noticing that something was this wrong!
</UL>
<li> April 21 2004 - Version 1.5.4 released - <strong>1926 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> A minor code restructure. Less code. Maybe less bugs...
</UL>
<li> Mars 23 2004 - Version 1.5.3 released - <strong>1918 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Another tuning.
</UL>
<li> Mars 23 2004 - Version 1.5.2 released - <strong>1855 points</strong> - <em>recalled</em>
<UL >

</UL>
<li> Mars 21 2004 - Version 1.5.1 released - <strong>1925 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Evades a bit steeper at close ranges.
</UL>
<li> Mars 21 2004 - Version 1.5 released - <strong>1923 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Just some minor tweaks.
<li> Should have started versioning 1.5.x with 1.4.5 actually.
</UL>
<li> Mars 19 2004 - Version 1.4.6 released - <strong>1921 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Yayalt. What happens if I switch off the flattener?
</UL>
<li> Mars 19 2004 - Version 1.4.5 released - <strong>1908 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to sloppy prediction.
<li> Fixed a bug with measuring delta bearing from the wrong origin.
</UL>
<li> Mars 17 2004 - Version 1.4.4 released - <strong>1890 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to 1.4.2 tuning.
<li> I bit less steep in evasion and instead generally backs away a little faster.
</UL>
<li> Mars 17 2004 - Version 1.4.3 released - <strong>1846 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Trying to make fewer untested assumptions...
</UL>
<li> Mars 16 2004 - Version 1.4.2 released - <strong>1874 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Tuned reverse and forward sensor placement.
</UL>
<li> Mars 16 2004 - Version 1.4.1 released - <strong>1893 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Same as 1.4 but without the flattener
<li> Fixed a bug with using the wrong distance measure for movement.
</UL>
<li> Mars 16 2004 - Version 1.4 released - <strong>1870 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Fixed a bug with using the wrong distance measure for movement.
<li> Switched on the flattener again
<li> Tweaked bin smoothing and distance to the reverse / forward sensors.
</UL>
<li> Mars 13 2004 - Version 1.3.6 released - <strong>1893 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> I don't expect it to work. It's YAYALT
<li> Purely adaptive movement. (Removed the flattener.) This is beacause <a href="robowiki@Jamougha" class=wikipagelink>Jamougha</a> told me to try get that to work first. Probably better against weak bots but worse against strong this way.
<li> No future position prediction. Now I just look ahead some 50 pixels and look backwards 2 pixels and see where I have least impact from a previous hit. Massive bin smoothing as per suggestion from <a href="robowiki@Rozu" class=wikipagelink>rozu</a>.
</UL>
<li> Mars 11 2004 - Version 1.3.3 released - <strong>1882 points</strong>
<UL >
<li> Back to bin smoothing. But now linearly instead of using the square root of the distances.
<li> Some strategy tweaks too.
</UL>

So the increased granularity of the 1.6.4.1 gun segmentation slows learning down a bit too much it seems. But it makes for a pretty good <a href="robowiki@PremierLeague" class=wikipagelink>PremierLeague</a> bot since this segmentation seems strong against the more sophisticated movers. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
According to the <a href="robowiki@TargetingChallenge/Results" class=wikipagelink>TargetingChallenge/Results</a> I have a badly broken gun in Pugilist. I must check the results though, since 1973 rating points with a 87.59 TC gun sounds pretty incredible. But if it holds true I have a point or two to collect by fixing the gun. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Well, it seems that it is the smoothing of the gun stats that "breaks" the gun. Now I have an interesting case where two versions of P have about the same rumble rating (1973 and 1972, which is within the margin of error) but dramatically different gun ratings (87.59 and 92.06 respectively)... I know of only one difference in movement in these two bots; the number of stat bins for the enemy waves. Either the TC gun performance doesn't matter at all or the movement is much better with more stat bins. I might let an interim version of P become a megabot just to check... (It costs me bytes to use different number of bins for gun and movement.) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Forget versions 1.6.4.15-16. They shared a huge smoothing bug. I'll try those configs later probably. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Funny. With 1.6.4.34 I tried to make P stronger against the weak, scrificing strength against the strong. But it came out the other way around. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Not so funny. It's rather depressing that all my tries with purer surfing (the 1.9 line) so fails to collect even close to the points the wall-bouncing 1.6 line does.... And frustrating to! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Ah! My new 1.9 approach together with <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>'s good advice to allow wall bouncing at really close ranges made 1.9.3.3 jump up to compete with the stupid 1.6.4 line. Nice! I don't think the 2K club had a slot for 1.6.4.*. But I'm pretty sure a chair is free there for 1.9.3 and up. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Gah! I just realized I have a quite huge bug in the surfing of 1.9.3.3. Wonder if I dare fix it. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Ha! 1.9.3.3 finally managed to grab #1 in minirumble!!!!!!!!!!!!! That was hard work. Now P is the highest ranked mini in general rumble, #1 in minirumble and doesn't lose against one single minibot. Maybe a candidate for mini <a href="robowiki@TheBestBot" class=wikipagelink>TheBestBot</a>? It's more fun to say yes! =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Hey, that 1.9.4.3b seems very strong (1990+ with 500 battles!), it´s a gun improvement or movement? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
Strongest Pugilist ever! =) It was movement segmentation changes. Lost a lot against some bots, but gained more over all. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Seems that 1.9.5 solved that DevilFish<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=DevilFish" class=wikipageedit>?</a> problem:

</TABLE>
What do u think that solved the problem, that bouncing ifs or was it anything else? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
It was solved with 1.9.4.3+. Yes, the wall-bouncing-when-close really helps. But I also shortened the blind-mans-stick at close ranges, which makes P go less steep at the enemy when in close combat. It also gives me a wall-avoidance problem though which I am not sure how to counter. I think that on average P hits the wall two times each round. Not good!! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Truly strange that i 1.9.7.6 doesn't perform like 1.9.7. Obviously I don't understand my own code... -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I still don't get it. In 1.9.7 I fire an <a href="robowiki@EnemyWave" class=wikipagelink>EnemyWave</a> every tick. And if the enemy has fired I flag the wave as surfable. Then I only use surfable waves to update my reverse and forward danger guesses. In 1.9.7.6 I instead only fire enemy waves when the enemy fires. No need for a "surfable" flag then. This is the <em>only</em> difference. Apart from almost 20 rating points that is... -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Ha! Another 2K member, surelly feels good, ain't? Congratulations! Register it in <a href="robowiki@The2000Club" class=wikipagelink>The2000Club</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
I just did. And it sure feels good. Do I need to remind you P is a mini? =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<UL >
<li> I think u just did it :) -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
</UL>
<p>
(edit conflict!) And is also the first member of <a href="robowiki@The2000Club/Mini" class=wikipagelink>The2000Club/Mini</a>! What was afterall the feature that gave u the 2K? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
"The feature" was to go back to <a href="robowiki@Aristocles" class=wikipagelink>Aristocles</a> gun. It was that strange targeting bug that gave me the hint. It seems that the wall segmentation is really important. I'm tweaking it as of now and I think I can improve the gun a little more. We'll soon see if I'm right. <a href="robowiki@Apollon" class=wikipagelink>Apollon</a> was the first member of that club though. Depending on the entry rules I guess. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<UL >
<li> Why? Did Apollon reached 2K with 500, but dragged down after or it reached only in the mini score tables?
<li> It has 2K+ points in the minirumble. I think that's the entry ticket for that club.
</UL>
<p>
You did it! Great stuff, congratulations! :) -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<p>
Thanks! Glad I took that screen shot while I was still above 2K. It seems that fighting minis only drags my rating down. I just might release my first <a href="robowiki@MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a> in months just because of this. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

<li> I really don´t understand it , please explain it slowly (i´m a surfer), by beeing a mini the client priorize the battles against minis? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> 
</UL>
<p>
Yes, the client makes sure every bot in every class gets 500 battles. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Let me clarify that. First the client fills up a bots 500 battles in the general rumble. Then, if the bot is a mini, the client starts running mini battles until the bot has 500 battles fought there. (And this goes on if it's a micor or nano.) This means that after 500 rounds Pugilist had the general mix of battles. But then battles against minis start to get over representated. I don't quite understand why this lowers the rating for P, but it seems to be quite a consistant pattern. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Congratulations on joining <a href="robowiki@The2000Club" class=wikipagelink>The2000Club</a>, <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>!! It is well deserved since you are probably the most persistent robocoder around. --<a href="robowiki@Vic" class=wikipagelink>Vic</a>
