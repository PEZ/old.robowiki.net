"...There was no trace
Of aught on that illumined face..."
-Samuel Colerige,"Phantom"
<p>
<p>
What's special about it?
It's my third bot at all and the first one that beats anything other than sample bots. I've started to work on it after about a week of robocoding.
<p>
Where did you get the name?
Hypnotic Specter is my favourite Magic: the Gathering card.
<p>
OK, I'll get anything for more testing, where it lies?

<p>
How competitive it is?
Well, it beats the samples...
<p>
How does it move?
AG random point chooser.
<p>
How does it fire?
Don't ask... But could be even worse ;)
<p>
How does it dodge bullets?
It has an extremely basic melee dodger code, but it tends to do the direct opposite of dodging.
<p>
How does the melee strategy differ from one-on-one strategy?
It's the weak point - it doesn't. The movement ticks only in melee and the gun only in 1v1, so it creates a weak bot in both.
<p>
How does it select a target to attack/avoid in melee?
Attacks the nearest, avoids all, hits walls.
<p>
What does it save between rounds and matches?
Between rounds - quite everything.
Between matches - nothing.
<p>
Can I use your code?
You really don't want to...
<p>
What's next for your robot?
Reasonable 1v1 bullet dodging.
<p>
Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhales" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhales</a>?
Theese fall into two categories:
Bots that shoot tend to kill it.
Bots that move tend to get its' all energy wasted for shooting to walls.
If anybody finds a new category, please please tell me...
<p>
What other robot(s) is it based on?
Hmmm... I've read all the sources I got and apparently chose the worst ideas. Still no single base for any system.
<p>
History:
v.0.4.4 got into about half of the stack in both 1v1 and melee. This is funny, as this version extremely often hits walls and offsets its gun badly(up to 45 degrees).
