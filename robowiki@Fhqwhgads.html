<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext><a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a> is the first robot made by <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a> since he started doing the Flood series that completely ignores his enemies firing in reference to when he chooses to change direction and such.  He doesn't ignore the power with which they are firing, he just doesn't react to the firing time at all.  It's a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> using <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>'s gun.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a> loves Strong Bad, so she (it's a girl's name) will cling to Strong Bad if she sees him.  Make a robot called <a href="robowiki?StrongBad" class=wikipagelink>StrongBad</a> and see what I mean :-p.   The movement is small, so I had plenty of room to just cram something stupid in there like that.
<p>
<UL >
<li> Version 1.0 - first version, I think the movement came out well and strong.  If I tweak the gun to be more coherent against the dev version of <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, it beats it by a small margin.
<UL >
<li> Takes second place in season 14 of the Robocode Outpost Pro league!  This is incredible!  It beat <a href="robowiki?FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> (don't plan on that anymore once <a href="robowiki?FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> gets more familiar with Fhqwhgads), and edged him out of second for the week, and actually was less than 800 points shy of taking the title from <a href="robowiki?SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a>!  Now THAT's exciting.
</UL>
<li> Version 1.1 - wow, all that stuff I always wanted to have in <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> but was afraid to fit.  I went ahead and took out dynamic distancing and kept only pretty simple distancing in place.  That opened up space to make the new Fhqwhgads melee aware (although I didn't put an actual melee *strategy* in there, it can basically just beat other one-on-one <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a> in melee), give it two "Virtual Guns" (one that fires a wave every scan and one that only fires a wave when it fires a bullet), and so all-in-all, it saves 4 times as much information as <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> does now, because it's saving constantly compiled and shot-only stats for both melee and one-on-one against every enemy.  Of course, if it's never seen the enemy in melee, the 0's compress nicely.  It also doesn't use exception handling to qualify its waves anymore (it took some space to do this without having him still crash about once every 50 rounds or so).  On my system, it appears to run at least 3 times faster, and I'm sure it will run exceptionally faster on other operating systems/JVM's than version 1.0 (much to <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>'s delight).  While this was a minor change for me, it was the driving force behind the release.  Still has colors :-)  Includes a little more ugly code :-(
<UL >
<li> Takes second in the <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge 20030802, beating everyone <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> lost to and then losing to <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>.
<li> Falls to 8th place in the RO Pro league (season 15).  This was expected, as it is less aggressive and will tend to play lower scoring battles now.  It still had better survival than <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> 1.3, who came in 3rd.
<li> Fhqwhgads finally gets onto the ER.  He didn't start in the top 10, but I'll make an excuse for my mis-prediction.  First of all, the dynamics of the top 10 have changed since I made that prediction - <a href="robowiki?CigaretST" class=wikipagelink>CigaretST</a> wasn't ranked, Sedan and <a href="robowiki?BlestPain" class=wikipagelink>BlestPain</a> didn't exist, and there were only 6 bots with a rating above 1800.  Now there are 11 bots with a rating above 1800, and this is one of them.  It's also 4th among <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a>, behind <a href="robowiki?Sedan" class=wikipagelink>Sedan</a>, <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, and <a href="robowiki?Cigaret" class=wikipagelink>Cigaret</a>.  The top 10 minis look like a big contest between <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>Iiley</a> and I now, with <a href="robowiki?Rozu" class=wikipagelink>Rozu</a>'s <a href="robowiki?GlowBlowAPM" class=wikipagelink>GlowBlowAPM</a> stuck in the middle of us.

<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

<p>
To quote <a href="robowiki?David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>, it moves the same against <a href="robowiki?SittingDuck" class=wikipagelink>SittingDuck</a> as it does against <a href="robowiki?SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a>.  Roughly, anyways.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1604">http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1604</a>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

<p>
I think it should be a quality bot - it will probably open 1-on-1 in the ER and the RO in the top 10.  The movement is good, and the gun is tried and true.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

<p>
It orbits its enemy in one direction for a random amount of time up to the amount of time a bullet from the enemy would take to reach it.  At that point, it changes direction about half the time.  The distribution of the 'distance function' is uniform, so if I always changed direction afterward, I'd probably have a Bell curve for a movement profile.  Doing it this way, I have a bell curve and a half of a bell curve to the right of the original one, which results in a reasonably flat profile.  It is amazingly simpler to tweak this movement than the <a href="robowiki?FloodMovement" class=wikipagelink>FloodMovement</a>, because if I move independently of individual bullets (except for the power of the last one fired), my profile should look roughly the same to about every bullet, regardless of how many there are.  That was my goal with this robot - rather than having the super-duper-flattest movement, it is meant to have a good movement that is pretty much equally strong at all distances.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

<p>
It uses a variation of <a href="robowiki?GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> ported over from <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>.  It segments its statistics on its opponent's relationship to the wall, acceleration, <a href="robowiki?LateralVelocity" class=wikipagelink>LateralVelocity</a>, and distance.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

<p>
It completely ignores them.  To help create a uniform profile, though, it knows when the bullets are fired and remembers the power of the last bullet fired by its opponent.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a> strategy?</H4>

<p>
It doesn't have a <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>Melee</a> strategy, it does have a <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>OneOnOne</a> strategy.  That's a pretty big difference.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

<p>
Dumb luck, if anything.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

<p>
It saves its statistics and <a href="robowiki?DynamicDistance" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistance</a> factors between rounds and matches.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

<p>
It's short for Fhqwhgadshgnsdhjsdbkhsdabkfabkveybvf.  Oh, and it's pronounced "Fuh-HOO-ku-gahdz".  Of course, you can get that from just about any online urban dictionary.  For those of you who aren't familiar with http://www.homestarrunner.com<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=Homestar_Runner" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, and you don't want to familiarize yourself too much, but you want in on the joke, then look at these pages (in this order, preferably) to get a general order of the state of the <a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a>:

I'm somewhat determined that it is the single most difficult name to spell among robots in current development.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

<p>
Yes, as long as you don't make a robot that can beat any of mine.  Ummm... just kidding.  If you do make a robot that's better than mine using my own code, though, I'd like you to let me know and make your robot open source as well.
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

<p>
Maybe some tweaking, find something more useful to do with the extra code-space.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

<p>
Eh, not really.  I made it in one day, so it hasn't had time to have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s.

<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

<p>
I love <a href="robowiki?StrongBad" class=wikipagelink>StrongBad</a> too! I think you might have a bug in your code because it's almost as slow as <a href="robowiki?Chameleon" class=wikipagelink>Chameleon</a>. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Hmmmm... Can't think of what that would be.  There shouldn't be anything computationally intensive about this robot.  More waves to manage if you're further away, but that's it.  "In the time it took me to run your bot, I could have done all sorts of cool stuff, like paint a picture... of a guy... with a big knife.  Whoa, I think I'm going to get started on that, right away!" -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
F doesn't stay far away from M. It seems to prefer a really close combat. It has run 698 rounds now so if we give it another hour and a half I'll have some results. Though it seems already like it's a pretty strong bot. Even if M outsurvives it by about 115%. And any bot that M outsurvives loses. =) But instead of painting kitch pictures you should hunt the <a href="robowiki?SlowBot" class=wikipagelink>SlowBot</a> bug I think. 36 fps is about the slowest bot I have tried. Only Chameleon is slower with 30 fps. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Now, 1000 rounds is not fun against <a href="robowiki?SlowBots" class=wikipagelink>SlowBots</a>. =) Anway, M has a slight edge on this bot, it won 533 - 467 in survival and 47241 - 42909 in bullet damage. I guess this might be a top-10 bot after all. I'm intrigued by the movement scheeme, it sounds a bit like Ms actually. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I just had <a href="robowiki?Sparafucil3" class=wikipagelink>Jim</a> try it out - in his tests, Jekyl gets about 60 fps against the main bots he's currently testing against (the <a href="robowiki?Aspid" class=wikipagelink>Aspid</a>s and <a href="robowiki?Nibbler" class=wikipagelink>Nibbler</a>), about 300 FPS against <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, between 200 and 300 for <a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a> (the only speed difference should e that <a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a> saves data every round, where <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> only saved when he won).  Against <a href="robowiki?Marshmallow" class=wikipagelink>M</a>, he said it started out at around 200 and then picked up to over 300 FPS.  So I'm still not sure what the nature of this slowness is.  One thing you could try is changing my Vector of MiniBullets<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=MiniBullets" class=wikipageedit>?</a> into an <a href="robowiki?ArrayList" class=wikipagelink>ArrayList</a> or something.  But, again, that shouldn't make it different from <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>, who also uses a Vector.  Do you have a problem with bots whose run method basically consists of turnRadarRight<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=RadarRight" class=wikipageedit>?</a>(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)?  (That's also a difference from <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> 1.3, but the dev version does it the same way as here) -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
As expected it doesn't matter if I use an <a href="robowiki?ArrayList" class=wikipagelink>ArrayList</a> instead of a Vector. I think Vector is just a synchronized wrapper around <a href="robowiki?ArrayList" class=wikipagelink>ArrayList</a> or some such. Of course you should only use Vector if you need the synchronization. Which you should seldom need. Even with a multithreaded bot where you should probably work with immutability and such measures to avoid synchronization. Also you should almost alway use interfaces (when they are provided) for the type specification of your objects. In the case of <strong><a href="robowiki?ArrayList" class=wikipagelink>ArrayList</a></strong> and <strong>Vector</strong> they share the interface <em>List</em>. If you use it and find you want to switch from <a href="robowiki?ArrayList" class=wikipagelink>ArrayList</a> to Vector or vice versa you only need to do that in one place; at the point of object creation. But as for what causes Fhqwhgads (there should be a penalty for using such names... =), I don't know where it could be. Since I'm using Java 1.3.1 maybe it has to do with that. But not for your other F bots. Strange. I'll fiddle around a little and see where it brings me. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I'm at loss here. I guess it might be it's name. =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Well, I must say, if your OS has some sort of localization feature where it tries to pronounce words for you, I could see <a href="robowiki?Fhqwhgads" class=wikipagelink>Fhqwhgads</a> slowing it down.  Good thing I didn't call the robot "Fhqwhgadshgnsdhjsdbkhsdabkfabkveybvf".  I actually took a screen shot of the Strong Bad email to get that spelling all down.  And it would be quite embarrassing to have spelled Fhqwhgads wrong, too.  Just out of curiosity, have you looked at the movement scheme?  Is it at at similar to Marshmallow?  If it is, I think you should get working on MarshmallowMini<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=MarshmallowMini" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, because I'm sure that the movement is nano-able (with a very simple gun and no distancing). -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Eh, MarshmallowMini<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=MarshmallowMini" class=wikipageedit>?</a>? Don't think so. It's movement is small enough to fit in a mini, but it's targeting and Melee enemy manager won't. Besides, I think coding with codesize in mind is both a bit bizarr and a bit ridiculous. It has been good for my understanding of Robocode to try it some with Gouldingi, and I might write more minibots when I want to explore new concepts. But I will never try to compete in the mini disciplines. I'll leave the ugly-coding contest to others. =)
<p>
On the subject of movement. This looks veru much like early M movement. Though I wasn't aware of flatness issues then so I think I might have scrapped it for the wrong reasons. Ms' current movement is also simple, but not as simple as this. Ms' movement wouldn't fit in a nano without gun I think. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Fhqwhgads runs smoothly on my system. Against Ender i got to a speed of 400/500 fps. Maybe this is again one of those JDK 1.3 particularities? Also i had a very good laugh with those Strong Bad cartoons :-) Great fun! -- <a href="robowiki?Vic" class=wikipagelink>Vic</a>
<p>
It's still a <a href="robowiki?SlowBot" class=wikipagelink>SlowBot</a> in my book. I also like StrongBads<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=StrongBads" class=wikipageedit>?</a> e-mail! I laugh out loud watching. One of my favs is when he gets a question about whether he can play the guitar. I wonder how he can type with those gloves though. =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Lol, yeah, I love the Guitar one, too.  I can almost quote it from memory in my best Strong Bad voice. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
I just noticed that <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> is just as slow on my system. And since it is I am suspecting the truly ugly try/catch piece of code that I guess is a minibot-thing for you not having to check your array boundaries. I guess some JVMs handle it with better performance, but the JVM I'm using doesn't like it at all. I can't really test it since I don't quite know what's going on there. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
That's something to try, actually.  Change that to something like this:
<pre>
int guessindex;
if ((guessindex = b.updateEnemy(x, y, time)) &gt;= 0)
{
	stats[b.wallrel][b.accl][b.latspeed][b.dindex][guessindex]++;
	ovbullets.removeElementAt(i);
}
else
	i++;
</pre>
It won't perform as well in melee (doing that try-catch thing accidentally pushed me up 32 spots in melee on the ER because it stopped me from having extremely off-the-wall data) and it may *occasionally* otherwise crash (but it physically shouldn't), but that's roughly how it was in version 1.2, and I did that mostly to clear the space for the acceleration segmentation.  I actually got the idea from <a href="robowiki?Tobe" class=wikipagelink>tobe</a>'s Calypso.  See if that doesn't make a huge difference.  As far as I can tell, <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> should be the fastest bot in the top 20 except for Marshmallow and Gouldingi.  And this exception block is probably the only thing that could POSSIBLY make it slower than HT 0.8, which is also one of the fastest among top bots.  Let me know if that fixes the whole problem, and maybe I'll appease you in the next version and not do that.  I found some other space that I hoped to use in <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> to either put OCM in or tune the gun for multiple powers, but I suppose this could be worthwhile, too. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Yes, that was it. Now Fhqwhgads is one of the fastest bots I have in my robot directory. Do as you please with this. I'll just keep you on the <a href="robowiki?SlowBot" class=wikipagelink>SlowBot</a> list until it's fixed. =) And, of course, since skipping array boundary checking and using try/catch instead is a big NO-NO, it's bad for your <a href="robowiki?Jarma" class=wikipagelink>Jarma</a> as well. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Ok, the next version of Fhqwhgads won't do that, and should therefore run mega-fast on other operating systems/JVMs<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=Fhqwhgads/JVMs" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.  Of course, I'm on the verge of a whole new generation of Fhqwhgads (I should almost call it 2.0).  It will sacrifice <a href="robowiki?DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> (it's so much easier to keep a uniform profile at all distances with this movement) and become melee aware, separate melee and one-on-one statistics, and it will have two virtual guns - one that fires waves continuously like <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> and one that only fires a wave when it fires a real bullet.  The wave will also be variable speed and I will segment on predicted bullet travel time instead of distance.  Basically, it will be more powerful against robots that might have otherwise given it trouble.  And it will still be a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>, if I have anything to say about it (I just need to find another 10 or 15 bytes I think).  Sounds almost like a <a href="robowiki?MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a>, doesn't it?  But it will be simplified still in a few places. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
That sounds very much like a <a href="robowiki?MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a> project. Can you really fit all that in a mini? <a href="robowiki?Mako" class=wikipagelink>Mako</a> uses sets of <a href="robowiki?VirtualGuns" class=wikipagelink>VirtualGuns</a> like that. (One set firing every scan, and one set only firing when the real gun fires.) I can recommend it. =) Funny that you think about sacrificing <a href="robowiki?DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a>, since it looks to me like this bot really proves the value of it. At first I thought this bot was a piece of cake for Marshmallow. That was after the first 200 rounds they battled and F had for a majority of these battles performed a really close distance fight. After 1000 rounds M still had an edge. But after having fixed the <a href="robowiki?SlowBot" class=wikipagelink>SlowBot</a> bug I have run many, many rounds and it seems F has choosen a long distance fight now and from there M can't beat it. Yet. M 1.9.1 might. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Yeah, I thought it would be interesting to basically put <a href="robowiki?FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> 0.9's next gun into a mini.  I tested it without <a href="robowiki?DynamicDistancing" class=wikipagelink>DynamicDistancing</a> against the top 20 and whiped its data and compared to my original tests.  It didn't perform as well against DT or Chameleon, but it did even slightly better against <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>Iiley</a>'s bots as a collective (this was already easily my best bot against <a href="robowiki?Wave" class=wikipagelink>Wave</a> pattern-matching), and its overall performance was close to the same.  So I decided to go for it and try all those things I could never fit into <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> (but got close).  And the melee awareness is so it maybe has the chance to win best all-around <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>.  It won't be *good* at melee by any means, but it will be better than all those Melee-ignorant 1-on-1 <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a> I figure.  Meanwhile, I may use the extra space I've found in <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> to stick the rest of <a href="robowiki?FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> 0.8's movement into it.  This makes these two bots more unique from each other more than anything else.  In related news, I'm thinking I can give you more space for a new version of <a href="robowiki?GouldingiHT" class=wikipagelink>GouldingiHT</a>.  You down? -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Oh, just a note from the development team - this version of Fhqwhgads seems to be particularly good against Marshmallow, probably even partially because it's natural tendancy is to let his opponent get almost as far away as they want.  I've found space, found bugs, found more space, and more bugs, and so on for awhile now.  I'm surprised that I could create so many bugs trying to make a couple of simple improvements to the gun.  The last one was particularly funny, but I did figure out that Fhqwhgads should be worthy of a roughly 30th place ranking with a pretty erroneous gun, maybe top 20 with a mal-tuned gun, and is probably top-15 material if it only uses the shot-time-only stat gun.  I'm hoping it's looking at about #8 or so with everything fixed in the aiming.  If I can pretend I have enough room for movement tweaks, I might try some movement tweaks before I release, too. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>

I'm considering over-tweaking Fhqwhgads's movement and making it a <a href="robowiki?MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a>, and re-releasing this version as FhqwhgadsMini<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=FhqwhgadsMini" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.  Part of the reason for doing this would be to justify making a <a href="robowiki?FhqwhgadsMicro" class=wikipagelink>FhqwhgadsMicro</a> and maybe nano, too :-p  The second reason would be to make a package kawigi.f_bots.  The third reason would be to get a clear win over the creator of Yngwie in the 'hardest-to-spell-robot-name' league, at least until <a href="robowiki?Loki" class=wikipagelink>Loki</a> makes a bot called "Yggdrasil".  The other option is to either decide that <a href="robowiki?FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> will be invariably better or that Fhqwhgads isn't worthy of being any more than a <a href="robowiki?MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a>.  I just thought I'd bounce that off people to see what your opinions are.  Should I take this further? -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>

As long as you have a different movement for the two bots I think it's very much worthwhile. Funny that you thinkg Yngwie and Yggdrasil being hard to spell. Not at all to me, but I guess that's because I'm a Swede. Yngwie Malmsteen, who's lending his name to the bot Yngwie, is also Swedish, though his real name is Yngve Malmsten. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

Go-on make a mega bot - it always seems a bit of a hollow victory when I just beat mini, micro and nano bots :) -- <a href="robowiki?Paul_Evans" class=wikipagelink>Paul Evans</a>

Speaking of your victories over minis, <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>Iiley</a> and I were bouncing scores back and forth yesterday (he has one heck of a megabot in the works), and I made "CigarQwhgads<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=CigarQwhgads" class=wikipageedit>?</a>", which was just Cigaret with <a href="robowiki?FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>'s gun.  In 3 or 4 1000-round battles, it never lost by more than 10000 points, regardless of whether either of us had pre-saved data. -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Hmmm... It looks like you've found that Iiley's movement is particularly good.  I was contemplating lifting the movement from Cigaret and dropping it into <a href="robowiki?SandboxMini" class=wikipagelink>SandboxMini</a> for the final minibot showdown - but it did not seem like fair play.  BTW what does 10000 point represent as a percentage of the total score? -- <a href="robowiki?Paul_Evans" class=wikipagelink>Paul Evans</a>
<p>
I don't know, seems like it was around 80000-830000 for <a href="robowiki?SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a>, and 71000-78000 for CigarQwhgads<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=CigarQwhgads" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.  Cigaret 1.31's movement is actually superb.  I considered the same thing, but likewise, it would seem uncivil to exploit his open-sourceness by beating him with his own movement.  Of course, CigarQwhgads<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=CigarQwhgads" class=wikipageedit>?</a> takes 200-300 rounds to catch up with Cigaret in learning.  It did still catch up, though.  One difference between DT and Cig is that Cig isn't optimized against his own guns ;-) -- <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Sounds like around 52.5% of score to DT - around 25 rating points - I can live with that - of course the new DT will make that 53.5% :) --  <a href="robowiki?Paul_Evans" class=wikipagelink>Paul Evans</a>
