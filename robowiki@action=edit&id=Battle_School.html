Battle School is a place up in space where two armies of 40 each try to kill each other, in a book called Ender&#39;s Game.  Now it is going to be part of Robocode!

=== Comments ===
I have an idea that I would like to try it out.  It is based off the book Ender&#39;s Game/ Ender&#39;s Shadow.  Anyway, each person creates a 40-person Army.  The Army can be broken up into a bunch of little teams.  Each team is called a Toon.  Make sure your Toons don&#39;t fire at each other!  Then, the armies face of on a 2000x2000 battlefield!  The last army standing wins!  I am working on an army now.  If someone has questions, ask them.  --[[Bayen]]

Could 80 tanks on a battlefield fit into any reasonable amount of RAM? Doesn&#39;t seem like it, but somebody else probably knows better than I. -- [[Voidious]]

I tried it before posting and it wasn&#39;t that bad.  It went pretty slow for the beginning, but the whole round was over in less than 5 minutes. --[[Bayen]]

I tried it too, its possible! And it seems to be funny :) I would prefer a 5000x5000 Battlefield, but we´ll need a zoom function... --[[Krabb]]

Ha... in that case, I may be up for writing a team (of teams) at some point, but right now I&#39;m a bit obsessed with [[Dookious]] :) And I think 2000x2000 is kinda small for 80 bots, too, but I&#39;m sure a lot of them are wiped out quickly anyway. I&#39;ll definitely watch some battles if two people make teams here. I still think RAM could be an issue depending on the bots, though, and you may need to put some kind of limit on storing data. You could even require all [[PerceptualBot]]s. Good luck! -- [[Voidious]]

I have done a quick hack names Ownage: http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=2863 --[[Krabb]]
