Beat SpinBot better than anyone else. Setup:
# The results must come from 1000 round OneOnOne battles - Challenger vs SpinBot
# Battlefield size is 800x600
# Best score share (percent of total score) wins.
## If two bots get the same score share - the Challenger with the highest score wins
# Your bot must extend Robot

And if you write a bot to extend Robot, consider entering it in the ExtendsRobotCompetition! -- Alcatraz

Does anyone know why SpinBot sometimes stops spinning and drives straight until it hits a wall? I&#39;ve looked at the code and I can&#39;t figure out why it does that... --[[David Alves]]

No, but it can help me beat it, as it loses energy when it does so :) So far my main effort is beating SpinBot, but the best % I&#39;ve got is 63.46, total of 126500. Actually I think Walls extends AdvancedRobot, making it invalid -- Alphax

Good point on walls, I removed it and posted my score so far. AntiSpinBot? only gets hit in the beginning of rounds where it starts next to SpinBot and occaisionally when the &quot;go straight bug&quot; kicks in. Maybe I&#39;ll try again later, I&#39;m going over to my girlfriend&#39;s house to watch the presidential debates.

AntiSpinBot does not fire. :-)

--[[David Alves]]

My entry: dummy.St00pid. I bet I can get a better score if I implement some wallsmoothing and a better prediction of incoming enemyfire. But I&#39;ll do that some other time; it&#39;s 3am here right now, so I&#39;m off to bed :-)

Only difference between Krazy 1.45 and the version I used for this is that this version doesn&#39;t change directions. With some tweaking it can be better. -- Alcatraz

SpinBot goes straight when its turning (setTurnRight(10000)) is complete. At that moment its moving (ahead(10000) is not yet complete. Therefor it goes in a straight line until its movement is complete. To correct this, just increase the number of turns to take. However, tampering with the samples is not allowed I think. ;-) -- GrubbmGait

The solution is of course to not get hit by SpinBot. Or hit it with bullets. That way it will die before it runs out of turns. -- PEZ

Actually, sample.Walls extends Robot, so it&#39;s results are valid... --Dummy

The reason sample.SpinBot sometimes just drives straight is when his &quot;setTurnRight(10000)&quot; runs out and his &quot;Ahead(10000)&quot; still has some distance remaining. --Goofy

Nice scores everyone. By the way Dummy, this is PEZ&#39;s challenge not mine. --[[David Alves]]

My challenge? Hardly. This is the RoboWiki. So it&#39;s everyones challenge. But, yes, I founded it. I didn&#39;t find a reasonable way to sign the foundation though. =) -- PEZ

I mean you proposed the challenge. He credits me in his bot&#39;s source. :-P --[[David Alves]]

*Ah, I&#39;m sorry. So many challenges going on around here got me confused, I guess :-p. --Dummy

David, grab my SpinBotHunter from the RobocodeRepository and stick my gun on your movement. --Goofy

Thanks for the offer, but you&#39;re a bit too late, I just fixed the bug in the gun. I forgot to convert from radians to degrees. Also added more intelligent dodging at the beginning and end of the round.

--[[David Alves]]

Wow Dave! Can&#39;t you publish the code now? -- PEZ

There&#39;s still a bug in movement. I&#39;m still around 91% if I don&#39;t fire. I&#39;ll publish soon though. :-) --David Alves

Heh, well, since you seem to have gotten to the end of this challenge, I guess I can cease developing my SpinBotHunter. I was going to model what happens when he starts walking, so that I just have to scan him once, then I just have to fire exactly the right number of bullets and it&#39;s all over. But that seems useless. --Goofy

The end of the challenge is 100%. I may be ahead but I haven&#39;t won by any means. ;-) --David Alves

Is 100% the end? When writing &quot;If two bots get the same score share - the Challenger with the highest score wins&quot; I had 100% in mind. It&#39;s rather unlikeley any two bots would get the same score share otherwise. Anyway, I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to reach 100% with an extends Robot if I tried forever. When calls block, so do my brain. =) -- PEZ

What I meant was that this is a trivial question, now. Since Dave has some minor tweaks to prevent him from ever getting hit, and with some relatively minor tweaks, I could get a gun that not only never misses, but only needs to scan the enemy once, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much more to look for. I very much believe that a Robot can get 100% against SpinBot, and I see that as the end. --Goofy

It has to be proven first I&#39;d say. In 1000 rounds lots of start positions get tried. -- PEZ

I think the limit is roughly 99.7%. In other words about half of the damage I&#39;m taking right now is preventable, the other half is just due to bad luck in start positions. --[[David Alves]]

--[[David Alves]]

Do I get any credit for inspiring the SpinBotChallenge :P ? --Alphax

I think you just claimed it. =) -- PEZ

While we&#39;re making extends-Robot challenges, how about samplebot melee? Your bot vs. all the sample.* bots that fire (everyone except Target and SittingDuck) on a 1000x1000 field. Melee seems like it would be very hard to do well if you can only use blocking calls, harder than 1-v-1 --[[David Alves]]

I&#39;d like such a challenge if it&#39;s not constrained to extending Robot. But don&#39;t let me discourage such a challenge anyway. I am lousy at doing anything non-femto with Robot and I have never given Melee stuff attention either. Thus, my vote shouldn&#39;t count much. -- PEZ

If it&#39;s not restricted to non-advanced Robots then just stick Shadow or Aleph in there and it&#39;s all over. --[[David Alves]]

I wonder if you can sneak inside Spinbot&#39;s turn radius, in which case he&#39;d never see you to target you.  This is just idle speculation, but I think if I were to take up this challenge I&#39;d sneak inside Spinbot&#39;s turn radius if I spawned close to him (and could make it before he started firing), or if I started far away I&#39;d just snipe his predictable bullets out of the air.  Meh.. I already spent too much time writing Ugluk.. -- Martin

I don&#39;t think it would be worth doing from a scoring standpoint. But personally, I think it would be a great trick to pull off. Clever! --[[David Alves]]

Walls could, at least most of the time, defeat all other sample bots. Walls extends robot...
The robot should have something like this:
All bots fire with HOT, so any movement should be fine
[[MeleePatternMatching]], when it is fixed, should do the trick for the targeting
Target the closest bot!
