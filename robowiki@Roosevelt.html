<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Well, today i stripped out all the complicated and un-necessary code from Roosevelt and found it works much better. This means no melee strategy, no dynamic distancing and far fewer guns. It isn't properly tested yet, but i can't really be bothered so i'll just let him run wild and see how he does.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

You can't quite yet, I botched in some ideas and code from a few test bots and i still have a couple of bugs i need to get rid of. Also it doesnt save data in between rounds, so i'll add that tomorrow morning then upload him.  
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

That's an interesting question. Currently in its v0.1 guise it's not very. It can push a few of the top bots to low energies quite consistently before being killed, hopwfully i can work some of this out either by tuning or actually putting some thought into my endgame. I'm hoping he'll place about 50th.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

Well, it is basically random movement that i added some APM to. This really helps it against pattern matchers but means it get crucified by anything else. I'll either tweak or remove this before i release.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

It has 2 guns, a guess factor gun and a pattern matcher, and i'm hoping that one will pick up the slack from the other. The guess factor gun is segmented into 6 dimensions, and the VGun array is loosely segmented into 4. 
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

Well at the moment i pattern match myself, then when i'm getting my new position, if this is close to the predict position i'll pick another spot. I found taht actual bullet dodging was incredibly difficult to do well.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

It doesn't - I ripped out all the melee strategy, the new version has never been in a match with more than 1 opponent. 
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

It doesn't, although i might make it so it just tries to take out DT, i'll do badly overall but it'd be worth it... :)
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Between rounds it saves movement, and targetting stats (PM Data, guess factors, VirtualGun<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=VirtualGun" class=wikipageedit>?</a> stats), i haven't sorted out between matches yet but it'll be along the same lines.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

There's an american band called "Slow Roosevelt", and when i was trying to think of a name i was listening to some of their stuff, just a coincidence really.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

Not at the moment and i doubt you'd want to either, it's pretty ugly and unorganised. I'll release it when i've managed to get the melee strategy sorted.  
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

Melee strategy, maybe another stat gun, tune some parameters, make it skip less turns, clean up the code. And depending on how it does i might rework the movement.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

I haven't really tested enough to work this out yet, but no doubt fermat'll give me some grief.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

It's not directly decended from anyone, although somewhere on these pages is Aspid's radar code, that i nicked - cheers albert! (that's the only code in the bot that i creamed straight off someone else). Other than that i've taken ideas from all over the place.
