Thought there needed to be something to start this out, and I&#39;m not too surprised to see PEZ outdo me just slightly here.  I am surprised that he did it with quite a bit fewer firsts. -- [[Kawigi]]

408.21 average bullet damage inflicted / round. --[[David Alves]]

Edit: whoops, didn&#39;t read this completely. Splitting it into two categories.

As I expected, circular targeting and staying relatively close pays off against the samplebots. The result is a yet undisputed 422.004 BDam/round.  -- [[GrubbmGait]]

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad for a nano.  -- [[Simonton]]

I think the result of [[Reach]] is proof that this challenge doesn&#39;t closely rate how good a bot is overall, as it would get slaughtered by most of the other bots here.  :) -- [[Tim Foden]] 28Jun07

None of the challenges on this site are ever the &quot;whole picture&quot;, but they&#39;re still useful and interesting for measuring a certain aspect of your bot. Whatever the case, that&#39;s a really impressive score, nice work! You gonna enter it in the MeleeRumble? Oh yeah, and welcome to the wiki. =) -- [[Voidious]]

Yes, I agree.  I&#39;ve tried some of the other challenges too, and so far [[Reach]] is pretty poor.  Now I&#39;ve figured out how to add stuff to the wiki, I may post my results in them.  I added Reach to the RoboRumble and MeleeRumble just before I noticed your post.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see how it does.  -- [[Tim Foden]] 28Jun07

Someone can remove the older [[Shadow]] if they want, I would think.  Anyway, watching Shadow in this challenge let me realize why using a play-it-forward instead of a GuessFactor technique for aiming would be superior in [[Melee]].  The revelation occurred when I say him hit [[Walls]] and [[SpinBot]] with perfect accuracy.  Lots of simple [[Melee]] bots run little patterns, which play-it-forward inherently predicts better.  Looks like whenever I take DynamicClustering to the [[Melee]] field, I&#39;ll be following [[Shadow]]&#39;s lead on that one.  -- [[Simonton]]

* I was thinking of making a GuessFactor2D gun, which should be just as effective as play-it-forward in melee, and probably better in 1v1 as well. Not only that, but it should be faster to boot, which means using a bigger log size, and extracting a bigger sample. -- [[Skilgannon]]
* I disagree.  Can GuessFactor2D perfectly predict SpinBot from any distance and any bullet power after watching it for only 1 long-distance wave (baring near-wall behavior, of course)?  -- [[Simonton]]
* What makes play-it-forward more powerful against pattern movers is that, unlike guessFactors (1D and 2D), it isn&#39;t relative to your own position. That&#39;s why I compared Tron&#39;s gun to a (statistical) pattern matcher. And yes, it works great in a melee. :) -- [[ABC]]
* Maybe the description on the GuessFactor2D page isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;m thinking =). What I would do is to create a circle of possible area that the bot could reach, and then measure how much the bot moved either to the left or right of the line of its original heading in radians, and how much forward or back from its original position. So it is completely independent of my position. It would even be possible to fire several different waves at once, with different bullet powers. Although I see your point, [[Simonton]], the trouble with melee is that you &#39;&#39;don&#39;t&#39;&#39; have a continuous data stream, like in 1v1, so you can&#39;t 100% accurately reconstruct the enemy movements. Although I do see the advantages of the play-it-forward, I think this gun also has some advantages in 1v1, and for me the advantages it has in melee after that are just an added bonus =) -- [[Skilgannon]]
* That isn&#39;t &#39;&#39;GuessFactor&#39;&#39; 2D, though, since the definition of a GuessFactor is &quot;the bearing offset divided by the maximum escape angle multiplied by the lateral direction&quot;, and lateral direction is always relative to you. Maybe &quot;not-really-a-normalized-bearing-offset-2D&quot; targeting? =) -- [[AaronR]]
** Maybe the closest thing would be DisplacementTargeting, although I would do it relative to the enemy&#39;s heading, not my own. -- [[Skilgannon]]
* A guessFactor is always a scalable value/values, it may be independent of the enemy&#39;s heading but it&#39;s always relative to the bullet&#39;s ETA. With play-it-forward you build the data on the spot for the current situation. For movements that don&#39;t depend on the distance to you (=melee) it will always be more precise, IMO. And it&#39;s not that slow. The non-continuous scan data in melee is another problem, it affects all targeting methods. -- [[ABC]]
** Yeah, the scaling depending on bullet time does create a few problems. I could always use the BFT as an attribute, and fire many different speed waves at the same time. The main reason I&#39;m wary of play-it-forward is because of the 1 ulp accuracy (ie slow) in-built trig functions in Java. -- [[Skilgannon]]
** If you don&#39;t care for out-of-bounds checks for every step, you can do it without trig functions in the inner loop. You project your own location in relation to the enemy&#39;s heading and iterate using the enemies displacements (+dx +dy), then you convert the angle back to get the firing solution. That&#39;s how I do it ATM, it&#39;s pretty fast. -- [[ABC]]

Thanks for running Shadow 3.71 in this challenge, I forgot that the changes I did to my base gun class would influence the melee gun. The next version will be all about melee gun changes. I&#39;m testing something really cool, here is my latest test result: Score: 607630, Survival: 500, BDamage/round: 478.44. :) -- [[ABC]]
