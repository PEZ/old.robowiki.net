Autobot4

==== Author ====
Jim Stephens

==== Extends ====
AdvancedRobot

==== What&#39;s special about it? ====
This is mostly a cleaned up version of Autobot3 where I have tried to simplify the approach.  This is really my first robot

==== Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it? ====
http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=2616

==== How competitive is it? ====
Well, moderately competitive I guess - ranks about mid 80th overall.

==== How does it [[Movement|move]]? ====
It has 6 different movement patterns that range from zig/zag attack patterns and ramming to dodge strategies. It selects a movement pattern based on the weighted random choice and then adjusts the weights based on a win or loss in the round. 

==== How does it fire? ====
It has a statisical gun and when the stats don&#39;t look all that good it uses a linear/circular gun instead.

==== How does it [[DodgingBullets|dodge bullets]]? ====
One of the movement patterns chooses a new direction and speed every time it sees the enemy fire - however the other movement patterns don&#39;t directly dodge bullets.  I have a feeling that because it can change movement strategies during a fight it may screw up some statistical or pattern guns over the course of a battle.

==== How does the [[Melee|melee]] strategy differ from [[OneOnOne|one-on-one]]  strategy? ====
No melee strategy other than try to fire at the closest target.

==== How does it select a target to attack/avoid in [[Melee|melee]]? ====
No real melee logic.

==== What does it save between rounds and matches? ===
It does save the weighting factors between rounds, but nothing between matches.

==== Where did you get the name? ====
AUTonomous roBOT - but more from the cartoon about Autobots and Decepticons.

==== Can I use your code? ====
I have not published the code yet since it could still use a lot of cleanup work.

==== What&#39;s next for your robot? ====
I would like to get it down to minibot size.  Codesize for Autobot3 was 5500, Autobot4 is now down around 4k, but still a lot of work to do to clean this up.  I will probably have to eliminate some of the less useful movement patterns to get the code size down to mini size.

==== Does it have any [[WhiteWhale]]s? ====
Since the movement selection is a bit random it can win big or lose big against the same robot.  I guess I will just have to wait to see how it all averages out.  However it seems Fermat kicks my *$$ at this point and on the other hand it dominates Krabby 1.19.

==== What other robot(s) is it based on? ====
Snippetbot was the starting point.
