<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>A <a href="robowiki@NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a> version of the <a href="robowiki@SandboxFlattener" class=wikipagelink>SandboxFlattener</a> movement.  It's open source, and if you can't figure out what it's doing from the code, you're slow ;-)  (just kidding)  Similar to <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a> without any distance control, minimum time for a movement, or other 'fancy' stuff.  It also doesn't track its opponent's energy as closely.  Just the raw, basic idea I had for the movement originally, maybe with the benefit of tweaking from past implementations of the movement.
<UL >
<li> V. 1.0 - first version - I don't consider <a href="robowiki@NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a>s to be in beta.
<UL >
<li> May 5th - Surprised it started the <a href="robowiki@EternalRumble" class=wikipagelink>EternalRumble</a> as low as 107th place.  But, in doing that, it beat Dalek 0.97 (However it managed that) and roughly tied <a href="robowiki@SandboxMini" class=wikipagelink>SandboxMini</a> - note that they are two of the better statistical-type targeters that are just the sort I'm trying to dodge with <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a>.  However, he lost to several less competitive robots.
</UL>
<li> V. 1.1 - fixed a wall-avoidance bug that Rozu identified in one of my other bots.  One advantage to making them open-source :-)
<UL >
<li> Placed 63rd among <a href="robowiki@NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a>s in the <a href="robowiki@MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge 20030525.  It just pretty much lost a lot to the other Nanos, including Moebius but it beat HaikuCrazy<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=HaikuCrazy" class=wikipageedit>?</a>! :-P
</UL>
<li> V. 1.2 - squeezed the code a bit and made the movement more like <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a>'s.  Also added random aim.
<UL >
<li> Actually qualified for the <a href="robowiki@MiniBotChallenge" class=wikipagelink>MiniBotChallenge</a> Grand Final!  :-)  It was one of the three robots that didn't use pattern-matching that made it into this contest.  Of course, it got 2nd to last once it got there :-p
<li> comes in 117th at the ER.  I think the movement has room for improvement, and maybe it does, too.  But relative to other bots around it, it was actually a slight move up in the standings.
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

It's really small (249 bytes) and hard to hit consistently.  Just ask <a href="robowiki@NanoSatan" class=wikipagelink>NanoSatan</a>.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp@id=1421">https://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=1421</a>
<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

I think it will do ok, not meant to be super competitive.  My guess is that it will compete similarly to <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a>, and maybe do better against a few robots, but in general be less effective.  Neither is currently good against bullet-dodgers, and both have the weakness of no intuitive aim, rather just a flawed <a href="robowiki@HeadOnTargeting" class=wikipagelink>HeadOnTargeting</a> strategy.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

Uses <a href="robowiki@SandboxFlattener" class=wikipagelink>SandboxFlattener</a> movement, in its simplest and purest form.  Every time it detects a bullet fired, it does this:
<pre>
	currentVBound = Math.random()*20;
	currentDirection = (Math.random() &lt; .5)?-40:40;
</pre>
and its run loop has this in it:
<pre>
	setMaxVelocity(currentVBound);
	if (I'm going to hit the wall soon)
		currentDirection = -currentDirection;
	setAhead(currentDirection);
	execute();
</pre>
Sounds simple, right?  That's all I've been doing for the last month, pretty much (well, that and finals).
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

When it sees the opponent, it shoots at it, with a random offset.  Nothing fancy.  Makes it loose to <a href="robowiki@TheArtOfWar" class=wikipagelink>TheArtOfWar</a> and most of <a href="robowiki@Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>'s bots.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki@DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

It reacts to bullets by changing direction.  Where <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a> and other robots with similar movement don't react to bullets being fired for a while after changing movement, <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a> reacts to every single bullet (had to cut some extra code down somewhere, right?
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

It's strategy in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>Melee</a> is to get hecka-confused.
<p>
<H4>How does it select a target to attack/avoid in <a href="robowiki@Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a>?</H4>

Dumb luck I suppose.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

Nothing on purpose, but I suppose it keeps its speed and direction intact because they're static.
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

Same as <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a>, but smaller.
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

If you feel like it, a few other robots have (although I wrote it into most of them myself).
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

I don't know, probably nothing for this one, but that's what I thought for <a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a>, too.  Hopefully finish <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a> and maybe make a <a href="robowiki@FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a> to finish the family.  Well, it wouldn't be finished unless I were like David Alves and also made a FloodNanoMelee<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=FloodNanoMelee" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and FloodMicroMelee<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=FloodMicroMelee" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and FloodMiniMelee<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=FloodMiniMelee" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and FloodHTMelee<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=FloodHTMelee" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

haha, how about <a href="robowiki@Walls" class=wikipagelink>Walls</a>.  Or any robots that dodge bullets shot straight at them.
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

<a href="robowiki@FloodMicro" class=wikipagelink>FloodMicro</a>, <a href="robowiki@SandboxFlattener" class=wikipagelink>SandboxFlattener</a> (the test robot), the eventual <a href="robowiki@FloodHT" class=wikipagelink>FloodHT</a>

Ouch, trying to hit that is no fun. So far the only reason I'm not totally depressed by <a href="robowiki@NanoSatan" class=wikipagelink>NanoSatan</a>'s performance against it is that a: the move is meant to foil this sort of matching, and b: <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a> can't shoot back a whole lot better. Let's hear it for a gun versus a movement system ;) -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
And we see that the movement is both simpler and more important!  Q.E.D. :-P  In reality, though, <a href="robowiki@FloodNano" class=wikipagelink>FloodNano</a>'s movement isn't meant to foil pattern matching.  That's merely a side effect of movement that is random in reference to aiming.  It was meant to beat <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Not with the dev <a href="robowiki@NanoSatan" class=wikipagelink>NanoSatan</a> :P Hehehe... anyway, yeah, well, if it foils <a href="robowiki@GuessFactor" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactor</a> by eliminating patterns in it's movement it'll do decently against pattern matching ;) Anyway, it's one scary nano, congrats. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
