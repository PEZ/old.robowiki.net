Looking at the rankings a while ago, I think I see a lot of bots missing. At least 30 from the top 120s or so, because Carruthers is about 30 places higher that I've expected. Is it me, or do I need to go to sleep... -- <a href="robowiki?Nfwu" class=wikipagelink>Nfwu</a>
<p>
There are 84 missing in all that I can tell at this time. Thats really wierd, nothing I can think of can explain this. Seraphim only shot up about 5 [places as far as I know, however looking at the premier league results of a older version of seraphim there was more bots, not to mention Ascendant and <a href="robowiki?SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a> are missing. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Probably something happened to the participants page. I'll check it out and will definitely have 3 clients running overnight, so hopefully it will be fixed up before long... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Spoke too soon, the participants page looks OK to me. I don't see any text in my RR clients that says it's removing them, which is what would happen if they were removed from the participants page. Maybe somebody setup a new client and had it access the wrong participants page in the setup file? I've read of that happening before. Anyway, I just posted a new Komarious and I will have my 3 clients going all night - it should face everyone, and with each bot it faces they should re-appear in the listing. Here's to hoping! -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> Seems like one bot from each battle my client is running is a bot that's missing. I think that's a good sign and that's why it's running the battles. Once each bot gets another battle it should be fixed, I think. Would be good to know what caused this, though. Hopefully someone will have a clue about it and speak up =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<li> From your description it indeed seems that someone started a new client with a wrong (old) participants-url in it. As you already noticed it will repair itself when that new client is stopped and other clients keep running battles.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<li> Something has happened to the nano rankings. There are only 49 entries now although the missing ones are showing up in the regular rankings. -- <a href="robowiki?Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<li> They probably need to fight another nano rumble battle before they will show up again there. Maybe somebody with a <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a> could re-release their last version with a new number? -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<li> I have a new <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a> that I was going to release. -- <a href="robowiki?Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<li> I don't watch the <a href="robowiki?NanoBot" class=wikipagelink>NanoBot</a> ranking carefully enough to know how many should be there. Is 82 bots in the nano rumble the right amount? -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<li> It seems complete. Btw, you can put RUNONLY=NANO in your roborumble.bat file to force nanobattles only.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
</UL>
<p>
The rankings did disappear again. They will re-appear again, but it is somewhat annoying. Will anyone who setup a new client check the url's in the roborumble.txt file. You can find a correct example <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble/roborumble_txt" class=wikipagelink>here</a>.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>

Three questions:<br>

<li>First, is this only for roborumble? or does it count meleerumble and teamrumble?

<li>Third - not question, in meleerumble, it says 'Uloading results' instead of 'Uploading results'. How to fix?<br>

Does anybody here successfully run version 1.2+ of Robocode in their RRAH clients? I have this problem when I try to upgrade to 1.2. Technically, I should just be able to replace the .jar file, I believe; that's what I did to upgrade to 1.1.3. But when I do that for 1.2, I start getting this error:
<pre>
Exception in thread "Application Thread" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "pez.mini.Gouldingi 1.5"

That line in BattlesRunner<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=BattlesRunner" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.java looks like this:
<pre>
	int PointsFirst = Integer.parseInt((String) resultsTable.getValueAt(0,1));
</pre>
Anyone else had this problem while running 1.2+ versions of Robocode in their clients? I don't see what I could possibly be doing differently, so I'll be very confused if I'm alone in this problem...
<p>
--  <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Could it mayhaps be the change from the hashtable to a hashmap? --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
Where is that change? I did delete/rebuild the robot.database file and .robotcache directory immediately after switching, too, forgot to mention that. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
We really need to backlog this pages, tis huge. And also all the hashtables in robocode were replaced. Though i'm not sure why it would throw that exception, unless the input was null or simular, try printing the string to the console before parsing and see what it is. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
I did, it's like "voidious.mini.Komarious 1.0", IIRC, package/botname + space + version number. I'll do some more investigating, like comparing it to the 1.1.3 client's behavior. Maybe the indices got offset by 1 or something... -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
Hmm, does indeed look like something might be offset by 1. I didn't force the same 2 bots to fight each time, but... Here's the output for <code>resultsTable.getValueAt(0,1) + " :: " + resultsTable.getValueAt(0,2) + " :: " + resultsTable.getValueAt(0,3)</code> in 1.1.3 and 1.2:
<pre>
From 1.1.3:
Fighting battle 0 ... stelo.MatchupMicro 1.0,dummy.micro.Sparrow 2.5
2936 :: 1050 :: 210
RESULT = stelo.MatchupMicro 1.0 wins 2936 to 2145
Fighting battle 1 ... stelo.MatchupMicro 1.0,timmit.nano.TimDog 0.33
3941 :: 1300 :: 260

From 1.2:
Fighting battle 0 ... stelo.MatchupMicro 1.0,wiki.mini.GouldingiHT 1.0
wiki.mini.GouldingiHT 1.0 :: 2963 :: 1100
2936 :: 1050 :: 210
</pre>
I couldn't say immediately if this is a true "bug" in 1.2 or if the RRAH client just had a dependency on something that wasn't really guaranteed to be a certain way in Robocode, but we may need to update one or the other to get them to work nicely together again.

For each batle in meleerumble, is it fought only once? Because it's taking way longer than a 'normal' battle on most of them...unless  it's because i've never seen a battle that lasts that long --<a href="robowiki?Starrynte" class=wikipagelink>Starrynte</a>
<p>
It's only fought once, but there are 10 bots to process instead of 2 (in 1v1), so each individual battle will take longer. Each battle counts as 9 battles for each bot, though, usings its score % vs every other bot. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

Java 6 is the current standard for most everyone, but you gotta remember that must of us just never really get around to updating, and that robocode itself is built on Java 5.0, I myself have the jdk (and the jre of course) of 1.3.1, 1.4.2, 5.0 and 6 installed along with their documentation to give me flexability on my builds. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

Well, Mac OS X is still only up to Java 5, so I would strongly protest making Robocode require 1.6 until I can actually run it. =) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

Seems only I use the Sun defined numbers. 5.0 had a .0 and 6 they removed that so its just Java 6 now, funky but interesting. They just gotta complecate things huh. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

So who else is using Robocode 1.3.5 as their <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> client? So far, I haven't noticed any drastic rating fluctuations or anything, which is good. I would like to try re-releasing one of my bots and having most battles processed by 1.3.5 just to semi-confirm that it's basically "compatible" with older versions. (For those that weren't around, 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 were a little unstable and seemed to cause a 10-20 point rating boost for new bots processed by them.) -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

May be its because of his strange name (many mumbers) or because there are many JGAPxxxx versions in the rumble? Thats the only possibility i can think of. --<a href="robowiki?Krabb" class=wikipagelink>Krabb</a>
<p>
Actually, the issues are unrelated. =) I believe the 120 pairings vs <a href="robowiki?WeeklongObsession" class=wikipagelink>WeeklongObsession</a> (based on something <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a> once told me, same situation) is because JGAP had faced everyone but still needed to get up to the BATTLESPERBOT set on a given client; sometimes, a client will fall into a loop against the last bot that JGAP had faced and just run that battle until the bot hits the minimum battles. As for the uploading more than once, that's because JGAP is a <a href="robowiki?MicroBot" class=wikipagelink>MicroBot</a>; for a match vs a <a href="robowiki?MegaBot" class=wikipagelink>MegaBot</a>, it's only uploaded to the General rumble, while for <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a> or <a href="robowiki?MicroBots" class=wikipagelink>MicroBots</a>, it will upload two or three results (of the same battle), one for each rumble. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

I must unlearn what I learned in the past.  My previous bots only went up against other nanos and were scored thus.  In this competition, quite often I am up against Melee master bots who I cannot win against in close combat.  In these cases, it is more important to be able run away and "hide" in a corner.  This gets survival to around 5 bots left.  It then becomes important to have movement that is not to easily pattern matched against from afar and to really save power to try and get down to the last 2 or 3 bots.  This is the mistake I made with <a href="robowiki?DustBunny" class=wikipagelink>DustBunny</a> 3.2 - it ran towards the center with a few bots left to attack the remaining bots.  It then preceded to get pummeled by superior aim routines.  Head on Aim just doesn't cut it at close range :)
<p>
I now understand why <a href="robowiki?MeleeSeed" class=wikipagelink>MeleeSeed</a> is such a dang good bot.  It gets to a corner immediately and has a movement pattern that is just unusual enough that most true melee bots won't be able to easily lock onto in 35 rounds.  It also is very good at spreading out over a large area to foil no lead and full linear lead bots.  It also has a decent radar lock to target the closest bots, which Kawigi's bot is a bit deficient.  My bunny has hard to hit movement, a great radar, but tends to attract too much attention to itself whilst wandering around in and around corners.  It also has a lame 1v1 pattern which gets it killed by nearly any bot at the end.  My work is definately cut out for me here. --<a href="robowiki?Miked0801" class=wikipagelink>Miked0801</a>

<li> Maybe those last battles, which were nano-only, gave it the final push. Now it is running real random matches, so who knows what the result will be. Good to see you haven't forgotten how to make/improve a bot.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<li> And now it's Dustbunny coming from nowhere to take a small lead.  Go random rankings!  Perhaps one should make sure they are well ahead before declaing anything in this catagory :) --<a href="robowiki?Miked0801" class=wikipagelink>Miked0801</a>

I have noticed that new versions of nanos are only fighting other nanos now.  Is that normal? -- <a href="robowiki?Miked0801" class=wikipagelink>Miked0801</a>

<li> As far as I know, it should fight <a href="robowiki?MegaBots" class=wikipagelink>MegaBots</a> until it hits min battles in General, then <a href="robowiki?MiniBots" class=wikipagelink>MiniBots</a> until min battles in the mini melee rumble, and so on. Once it has min battles in the micro rumble, it would only fight nanos. Looks like <a href="robowiki?DustBunny" class=wikipagelink>DustBunny</a> already fought all the <a href="robowiki?MegaBots" class=wikipagelink>MegaBots</a>, right? -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<li> <em>edit conflict</em> No, that's not normal.  Are you sure they haven't just already filled their battles requirements against the bigger bots?  Either that, or whoever's running the client has it set to just run nanos ... -- <a href="robowiki?Simonton" class=wikipagelink>Simonton</a>

Is it allowed to save data to file between battles in roborumble?
is there a memory limit?  -- Marco M B
<p>
<UL >
<li> It is allowed, but keep in mind that the data is only saved on one client - if you fight another battle against that opponent on another client, you won't have the data you saved. The size limit is 200kb (total), which is the default quota in Robocode. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

I am trying to run a RR@H server to locally compare a set of robots, with little success.  Is it possible to put local addresses in roborumble.txt instead of web links/repos nums? -- <a href="robowiki?BigPete" class=wikipagelink>BigPete</a>
<p>
Solved.  For others, the address in roborumble.txt is only used if the jar can't be found under ./robots  -- <a href="robowiki?BigPete" class=wikipagelink>BigPete</a>

Wow so many robots needing battles (2 of them are mine), i'm firing up my client and i'm gonna let it run for a nice long time. (luckly its on a remote system so it doesn't bother me) --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

serenity.nonSense_1.36 test crashes my client with an IndexOutOfBoundsException<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=IndexOutOfBoundsException" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, junkly its on a shell loop, but it I want to ask that either the owner fix it or remove it. Its good to see a old robocoder back and about though. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<p>
It works once in awhile, thought it does often, meaning that I get a nice long buildup of battles to upload when it actually manages to do so, so i'm gonna watcha movie while this run (on a high end core 2 duo with plunty of ram and no GUI to load it down). I hope this can catch up the battles. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

<UL >
<li> Probably because serenity.nonSense contains <strong>underscores</strong> in its versionnumber.   -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<li> So an underscore an a version number will sometimes cause an index out of bounds error while running and sometimes not at all? Who woulda thought? No actually I think its a programming error. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>
<li> Yikes, telling <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a> that "reading is a basic skill"?? Anyway, it should be easy to see if the exception is being thrown from a <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> / Robocode class or from the bot itself. Some cursory Googling of the wiki seems to show that IndexOutOfBoundsException<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=IndexOutOfBoundsException" class=wikipageedit>?</a> is the one thrown for the underscore version issue. -- <a href="robowiki?Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<UL >
<li> The problem being is that it always doesn't throw it, now I apologize, I can be a tad harsh, but why would it sometimes cause an error and sometimes not, and when it does generally cause it half-way through a battle? I'm sorry I didn't mean to be quite so bad, I supoose I should of explained things better. It just doesn't make sense based off the evidence. --<a href="robowiki?Chase-san" class=wikipagelink>Chase-san</a>

I didn't expect to get the 3rd degree, and when I did well, it feels bad, its not something I enjoy, so i'll just leave for awhile and perhaps in time people will forgive and forget, or atleast forget.

<li> No hard feelings. It is a strange problem without a satisfying solution (yet). It only happens with priority battles when the 'misnamed' bot is listed as second (if I remember correctly, it may be as first). It has to do with the internal translation of underscores into spaces and vice versa. I have looked at it, and so has <a href="robowiki?Fnl" class=wikipagelink>Fnl</a>, but we did not find a solution for it. That is the reason it is listed as 'strong recommendation' on the <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble/EnterTheCompetition" class=wikipagelink>/EnterTheCompetition</a> page.  -- <a href="robowiki?GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>

Testing <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> on my own pc with packaged teams gives some interesting results.

I was hoping someOne could  help with getting my bot in the roboRumble /melee ...
it says to take note of the "id" # when uploading it to the Repository , but  I can't locate it :(
<p>
- my bot is jlm.javaDisturance. -Justin  (jlm0924).  
<p>
You go to the [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robocoderepository.com">[Robocode Repository]</a>] and click the "Bots" link, from there, find your bot's page and look at the URL which should be something like "http://www.robocoderepository.com/BotDetail.jsp?id=3645", and the id number there is the number. In the case of jlm.javaDisturbance 0.59 it's 3645. -- <a href="robowiki?Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>
<p>
I didn't realise it was the url .. Thx Rednaxela 
<p>
I added my bot to the Melee / participants list above .. several hours ago. I don't see it the melee /general rankings. Was there something else I needed to do ? Not sure how this works, thx guys  .. -Justin
<p>
Well, now it is in the [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://rumble.fervir.com/rumble/Rankings?version=1&amp;game=meleerumble">[Rankings]</a>]. There wasn't anything you did wrong, you just had to wait longer. <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> battles are run not on the server but on the computers of individual robocoders who donate some CPU time to the task. If you want it to show up quicker, you could always run the <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home client yourself too :) Also note, rankings take longer to show up for Melee than for the other leagues, because melee battles take longer to run, and because I suspect most <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> clients are not running melee as well. One other quick note, is that don't take your initial ranking too seriously yet, generally rankings don't stabilize until a bot has reached a decently large number of battles. Some of what I said you may already know, but I'm just making these points just in case. Best of luck in your Robocode endeavors :) -- <a href="robowiki?Rednaxela" class=wikipagelink>Rednaxela</a>

How do you get the <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> to loop after sending the results... --<a href="robowiki?Starrynte" class=wikipagelink>Starrynte</a>
<p>
Type this in the .bat file:
<pre>
:run
java -Xmx512M -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -cp libs/robocode.jar;libs/codesize.jar;libs/roborumble.jar roborumble.RoboRumbleAtHome ./roborumble/roborumble.txt
goto run
</pre>
<p>
or  set "ITERATE=YES" in roborumple.txt
<p>
I hope that helps --<a href="robowiki?Krabb" class=wikipagelink>Krabb</a>

To the author of as.xbots: The filename should be &lt;as.xbots_1.0.jar&gt; (note the underscore instead of space). Although Robocode itself has no problem with the current name of the jar-file, <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> is not that intelligent and can not handle it. And ofcourse welcome at the wiki, it is always nice to see a fresh rammer trying to take the ram-throne.
