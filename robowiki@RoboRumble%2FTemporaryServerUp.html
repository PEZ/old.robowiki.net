Hello folks! While we wait for <a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a> to get the RR@H server serving us on his machine I have started a server on my workstation. In The Big Crash we lost a full year of RR@H battles. This means we have around 35,000 battles that must be run before we get a stable ranking. (If my calculations are correct)
<p>
The temporary server has a public interface on the pezius.com domain. So you must all edit your roborumble.txt files to participate in this recovery effort. 
<p>
Note that not only the URL for the servlets has changed. Also the URL to reach the particpants list must be edited:
<pre>
PARTICIPANTSURL=http://robowiki.net/cgi-bin/robowiki?RoboRumble/Participants
</pre>
(That's becuase I have no mod_rewrite privileges with the new hosting solution.)
<p>
The rankings look strange so don't look too close at them. What's important is that I accumulate battles log files on my machine and I can then mangle those slightly and turn them into uploadable battles that my client can later upload to Davids server.
<p>
What are you waiting for? Start your client now! =)
<p>
Regards,
<p>

Gah!!!! Sorry about this folks. But suddenly my temporary RR@H server is unreachable. And some other services are unreachable for me too so I can't fix it remotely. Watch this space for a message for when the bloody thing is working again. Good we have at least moved the wiki to a more stable environment! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

More clients anyone? Vic, you can use the same upload name for both your machines if you like. But maybe you want to see which machine is the most efficient? =)
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
No I just wasn't sure if I could give them the same name. Until now that name never showed up, so I never bothered checking.
<p>
Another thing: anyone who has started the client before the server went up again should restart it. My 'running' RR client could't find the Ratings file. It said: "All Ratings File not found!!!". and then it started the new iteration with "Using smart battles is false". It looked like it was running a lot of battles of old bot against old bot, and not bots that have been updated/added this last year. After restarting the client everything was fine again. I don't know if that is a freak occurence on my computer, but I suggest evryone restarts their client to be on the safe side.

I've seen similar beaviour before. Good that you remind us! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
My client seems to only run battles agains dft.Calliope, everything else looks normal. Is this expected behaviour? -- <a href="robowiki@Strider" class=wikipagelink>Strider</a>
<p>
Dunno! My client also zooms in on selected bots some iterations. I have set ITERATE=NO in my roborumble.txt settings so the roborumble client is restarted each time. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Ok. I restarted the client and it ran random battles the first iteration then only battles agains tm.Yuugao. I'll set ITERATE=NO too. -- <a href="robowiki@Strider" class=wikipagelink>Strider</a>
<p>
It's like that for me too. I have no clue why. ... Maybe it somehow populates the priority battles file during the first iteration and then acts on it the following? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> I looked through the RR@H client code and found out that when it uploads results the server sends back a list of battles that is saved as priority1v1.txt. This list is then used in the following iteration. So running many battles against one bot is indeed expected behaviour. -- <a href="robowiki@Strider" class=wikipagelink>Strider</a>

I managed to wake up the LRP graphs too. So now if you click on one of those links in the Rankings table things should work! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

Weird... My laptop is a 2.8GHz pentium 4, desktop is an AthlonXP<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=AthlonXP" class=wikipageedit>?</a> 3500+ (socket 939)... I knew my desktop was faster at running battles, but that much faster? It's 1440 uploaded vs. 113 uploaded, and I started them at the same time. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
I fixed <a href="robowiki@Jim" class=wikipagelink>Jim</a>'s request about presenting a default flag for bots lacking one. Now the Ranking table on the temporary server presents a pirate flag (<img src="http://pezius.com/rumble/pkg-flag/pirate.gif">) as a default flag. How did I do it? mod_rewrite of course:
<pre>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}   ^/rumble/pkg-flag

RewriteRule .*  rumble/pkg-flag/pirate.gif

How can the LRP applet be allowed to download the RatingDetails from a different path tree than it is itself loaded from (a tiny CGI in /perl)? mod_rewrite of course:

Run the robocode.bat file from yoru rumble directory to start robocode. When it finally shows up, close it out and restart RR@H.

<UL >
<li> The reason it takes so long the first time is because it has to unpack all jar-files into the robot cache. It may look like it has locked up but if you just give it some time it will finish.

It seems to be selecting focussed competitors at random. I ran 25 battles of pi.Dark earlier, and 25 of Cigaret... both of which have plenty of battles. Any idea why and how to fix it? We'll bring all bots up to 500 battles a lot sooner if it starts choosing competitors properly. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>

25 battles? My <a href="robowiki@PowerBook" class=wikipagelink>PowerBook</a> has been (and is still) running ONLY hundreds of DogManSPE<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=DogManSPE" class=wikipageedit>?</a> (extreme <a href="robowiki@SlowBot" class=wikipagelink>SlowBot</a>) battles! -- <a href="robowiki@Jonathan" class=wikipagelink>Jonathan</a>

My <a href="robowiki@PowerBook" class=wikipagelink>PowerBook</a> sped up because it chose another bot to test 100s of rounds. The PC didn't get anywhere, so I stopped it completely. -- <a href="robowiki@Jonathan" class=wikipagelink>Jonathan</a>
<p>
PEZ: All of the functionality of the current RR@H server code is now done in my version. I ended up rewriting everything from scratch, designing for extensibility and maintainability. I suggest that we let the new bots get up to 500 battles each (probably one more day) then start working out how we're going to transfer the data. If you'd like to play with uploading data to my app I can email you instructions on how to do that. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
That sounds promising! Why don't we point our clients your way right away? I'm constantly on my toes here, worried sick something should break. Win XP Home isn't exactly the dream server environment. Can I try with my client? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Test some first please :) -- <a href="robowiki@Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
<p>
Oh, ye of little faith! But I could make some results files by tapping the battles-log on my server on just a few of the 30,000+ battles it has collected oin just a few days. (YAAAAAAAYYYY!!!) Then my client can try upload those. And if that works we can start some 1,000 clients all over the world. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> 
<p>
It would be great if you could write a program to upload the battle data you've collected to my app. I'll email you details about how to upload right now. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a> 
<p>
Well, I have written a program that eats the battles log and spits out results files for the RR@H client to upload. Won't that work? Do you ever read your gmail btw? I've been one-way-communicating with you there for some days now. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Err, sorry about that. I've been very busy writing a program. ;-) I've already spotted a few oddities. The last run dates are off and the battles from the database are not shown in the details view, only the ones that have been uploaded this session. These are all easy things to fix and I'll do them tomorrow. It would be great if you could try and fill the app with battles... I'm curious what the capacity is. I need to verify that performance scales well to really large numbers of battles and need to be sure we aren't going to run out of memory. I'm estimating that there will be issues at around the 1 million battle mark.  Try it out and let me know. Don't upload them *too* fast though, don't want to melt the poor thing. :-)
<p>
--<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Well, here's what I've done:  Downloaded codesize.jar, installed a second instance of robocode, (renamed the folder roborumble), placed codesize.jar in /roborumble, downloaded beta 9.12 (bottom on the list at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geocities.com/albert_pv/RoboRumbeAtHome.html">http://www.geocities.com/albert_pv/RoboRumbeAtHome.html</a> ), unpacked it, tried running roborumble.bat, made a roborumble.txt file and copy/pasted the above text.  Still getting that error.  -- <a href="robowiki@Goofy" class=wikipagelink>Goofy</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki@Goofy" class=wikipagelink>Goofy</a>, try to paste here the exact output message... "Parameters File not found !!!" is a little generic. Is it from vm or RR? Can u run regular Robocode? Have u checked the .bat file paths? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> 
<p>
"Parameters File not found!!!" is the message that the RR@H client gives when it can't find the settings file you specified. For example, my RR@H command line looks like this:
<p>
<PRE >
 java -Dsun.io.use<a href="robowiki@CanonCaches" class=wikipagelink>CanonCaches</a>=false -Xmx256M -cp .;../robocode.jar;../codesize.jar; roborumble.RoboRumbleAtHome<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=RoboRumbleAtHome" class=wikipageedit>?</a> ./roborumble/roborumble.txt
</PRE>
<p>
If if can't find the .txt file specified as a command line parameter, you'll get that message. My guess is you extracted to the wrong directory or moved files after extracting. Double check that roborumble.bat is in the main robocode directory and that roborumble.txt is at /robots/roborumble/roborumble.txt --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Results seems not the same as before the BigCrash<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BigCrash" class=wikipageedit>?</a>... For example:<br>
abc.tron3.Shadow 3.25 2044.73 492 <br>
Seems that even with almost 500 battles we have differences of 20 points or so... The same with <a href="robowiki@SS" class=wikipagelink>SS</a>, its -20 pts from old score (same version)... Maybe 500 bats isnt enought to get it stable? Thoughts? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li> 500 battles hasn't been enough for some time, 700 is more like it, maybe even 800. -- <a href="robowiki@Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
</UL>
<p>
May be 500 it's not enough, but note that the rating of a bot deppends not only on its battles, but on the ratings of all the bots it fought, so as long they don't have an stable rating, a bot will not have it neither. -- <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>
<p>
It may also have to do with the fact that there is no "standard" bot... the ratings are free to "drift" up and down. Since expected score is based off of rating difference, all the bots could be 50 points higher or lower and the predicted scores would still be just as valid. That's why a few days ago I proposed that we set an "anchor" to prevent rating drift. For example, if we set tobe.Fusion to be 1600, whenever Fusion's rating drops below 1600, all bots have their ratings raised by that much. Whenever it rises above 1600, all bots have their ratings lowered by that much. If you read <a href="robowiki@Paul_Evans" class=wikipagelink>Paul Evans</a>' original document describing the rating system, he proposes doing this. Look under the heading "Standardising the Ratings" on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aqre94.dsl.pipex.com/robocode/rating.shtml">http://www.aqre94.dsl.pipex.com/robocode/rating.shtml</a> --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
I always thought that the ranking was something like the averaged sum of all ELO ratings... Can someone explain to me how the rating is calculated? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> 
<p>
Just found the page <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/RankingSystem" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble/RankingSystem</a>. Ill try to understand it... -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
I would think that an anchor bot would be good, but only after the ratings are stabelized. This may be hard to do before then. How would you know what bot to choose? Select the wrong one an everything could go kablooey. Lets wait and see once everyone gets to 500. Maybe we need to go a bit beyond 500. We all know that pre-loaded data pushes a bot's performance up some. The whole rumble just started with pre-loaded data on almost every other bot in the rumble. I personally think the only way to correct this would be to get everyone to wipe their data directories and start again. But this is not fair as some bots were built with pre-loaded data. -- <a href="robowiki@Jim" class=wikipagelink>jim</a>
<p>
Wow, just finished reading <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/RankingSystem" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble/RankingSystem</a>... I didnt fully understand the reasons of the ranking based in expected avgs instead of average % only, but I believe that <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a> &amp; co. had good reasons for that. Well, lets wait more battles to see if it gets stable... Btw: that 3 * (expected % - % of score)...  Where (if) does ELO calculation enter in that formula? Is that "expected %"? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
Yep. Like so: 
<p>
<PRE >
 public static double botOneExpectedShare<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=OneExpectedShare" class=wikipageedit>?</a>(double botOneRating<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=OneRating" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, double botTwoRating<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TwoRating" class=wikipageedit>?</a>){
 	return  1.0 / (1+Math.pow(20,(botTwoRating<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TwoRating" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - botOneRating<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=OneRating" class=wikipageedit>?</a>)/800)); 
 }
</PRE>

@Jim: We can tell which one to pick by looking at the archived rankings from before the big crash. I suggest either nic.Nicator or tobe.Fusion, both are very old (so they have a lot of battles), have relatively low specialization indices, and are around 1600. As a bonus, choosing one of them would also be an honor for someone who contributed to the robocode community, tobe ran the <a href="robowiki@MiniBotChallenge" class=wikipagelink>MiniBotChallenge</a> and Alisdair Owens (author of Nicator) wrote the <a href="robowiki@SnippetBot" class=wikipagelink>SnippetBot</a> tutorial and tutorials on <a href="robowiki@AntiGravityMovement" class=wikipagelink>AntiGravityMovement</a> and <a href="robowiki@CircularTargeting" class=wikipagelink>CircularTargeting</a>. Reading those tutorials is how a lot of ancient pre-wiki robocoders (like me) got started, and the <a href="robowiki@MiniBotChallenge" class=wikipagelink>MiniBotChallenge</a> is what kept me interested. :-) --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
I think we should wait until everybody gets 800+ battles, it looks to me like the rankings will stabilise very near to what they were before. The fact that many bots started with pre-saved data should probably change things a bit, PM bots will go down and data saving GF bots will go up. That would have been solved if everyone had wiped their robotcache before reseting the rankings, but after 250k battles it is a bit too late. Shadow is #1 in the PL now, so I can live with it... ;) -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<p>
<UL >
<li>Is data saving that useful after all? I'll spend some time there eventually I guess. Same for both movement and targeting data? -- <a href="robowiki@Pulsar" class=wikipagelink>Pulsar</a>
<li>I don't know, but many bots in the rumble use it, so it could explain a difference in the overall (relative) rankings. -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<li>FEI. <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> doesn't save data. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<li>I know, that could explain why you lost almost 10 points relative to RMX. I'll probably disable Shadow's movement data saving in future versions too. -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<li>Well, that could maybe also be explained with this CC being a different version. I'll replace it with version .05 later today to get a reference for my improvement efforts. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<li>BTW. I think maybe the discussion on how much the saved data of RMX and others means is a bit shaky given that many bots seem to retain their previous rating. Besides, <a href="robowiki@Pugilist" class=wikipagelink>Pugilist</a> has gained 9 points. And it doesn't use any saved data whatsoever. I think that any changes in rating are rather due to the randomness I've been talking about earlier, somewhere on the wiki. RMX could even have lost some points due to that randomness. And gained equally many points from the saved data... We just don't know. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<li> I was talking more in terms of a whole "class" of opponents affecting a bot's ranking. For example, if most of your problem bots are data saving ones, you would lose a lot if they gained .5 points each because of having pre-saved data. Anyway, this is also a different situation because we had a lot of "well-anchored" old bots that stabilised the ranking. Things will get better with time, imo. -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<li> How would that make you lose points? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<li> It wouldn't, replace problem bots with anti-problem bots in that sentence, or gained with lost... :) -- <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>
<li> =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
</UL>
<p>
Yes, we should have thought about clearing the .robotcache before this recovery effort... About rankings and anchor bots and such. I think many people who started worrying about this when we were at 300-400 rounds should at least now have learnt what it means whenever ABC and I play our tape with "wait for the bots to stop getting priority battles before drawing conclusions" recorded on it. In any case an anchor bot wouldn't have helped if those concerns would have had groundings. It would only help (maybe) with that drift David is talking about. A drift which I can live with at least. I only really care for relative performance anyway. Or maybe without the drift we would get better feedback with if a particular update of a bot is better or not? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
The main thing drift correction is good for is comparing rankings from different times. Drift correction ensures that 1800 is always 1800. Without it, you can't be sure how well an old version of <a href="robowiki@SandboxDT" class=wikipagelink>SandboxDT</a> (for example) would rate today. --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
But you could maybe guess how it would rank. =) Anyway, when we've got the rankings recovered and your RR@H server up and ready to serve we could add that anchor bot. Seems like a good idea. And then we can throw in both DT 2.11 and DT 1.61 a while to get a reference for our collective improvement efforts. Man; Did I, for a long while, feel DT 1.61 was almost unbeatable! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
It seems that <a href="robowiki@SS" class=wikipagelink>SS</a> 2.42 dropped about 10 pts in this new ranking... <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> also. Maybe i´ll try later a 2.42.reloaded, just to see if goes back to ~ 2042, but now ill try my new version. Btw: <a href="robowiki@ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a>, why dont u try a re-release of <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> 3.25 just to see if the enemies data make diff? -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
Any bot carrying data on Shadow is making a huge mistake. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Maybe. But a re-release could be a good test... -- <a href="robowiki@Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a>
<p>
Will there also be anchor-bots for mini, micro and nano ?  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<p>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
Can some one look at the compare servelet/jsp and see why it is not working? Now that we are all releasing bots again it would be nice to be able to compare our new performance to the old. Isn't there a mod_rewrite that could fix this? =^&gt; -- <a href="robowiki@Jim" class=wikipagelink>jim</a>
<p>
OK. I'm on it now <a href="robowiki@Jim" class=wikipagelink>Jim</a>. Though I've been staring at the code for two hours and can't see why it should fail. While digesting it I've put the <a href="robowiki@PremierLeague" class=wikipagelink>PremierLeague</a> in operation again. Look at <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>'s score! 294 pairings and zero, zilch, nada, no, not a single loss. So cool!
<p>
Anyway, you might experience some error messages from the servlets while I stop and start Tomcat here to test if I can get the Compare servlet working again.
<p>
-- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Found it! Some bugs are more subtle than others to track down. In this case an inner class was used where a regular class works just as well (at least from what I can tell). The strange thing was that the servlet exited and returned without complains when this inner class was instantiated. But when I moved it out of the enclosing class the servlet started to work again. Even stranger that this worked before but not on this install. Might be a bug in the servlet.jar library which I think is a bit dated on this machine. (I'm using a Tomcat distro which came with an old <a href="robowiki@NetBeans" class=wikipagelink>NetBeans</a> I tested quite a while ago.) Anyway. Now things work. Hurray! -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>

I have another theory for that diff. in <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> &amp; <a href="robowiki@SS" class=wikipagelink>SS</a> scoring after the BigCrash<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BigCrash" class=wikipageedit>?</a>...<br>
It must be the third time that i mention this here: The <a href="robowiki@JRE_1.4.2_SecurityException_Bug" class=wikipagelink>JRE 1.4.2 SecurityException Bug</a>...<br>
Clients running jre 1.4.2 or higher, without the add of the option "-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false" in the .bat file, can leave disabled any bot using save/load of data... And the RR@Home clients for downloading arent coming with that issue. this is how their roborumble.bat should look like:<br>
<pre> 
cd robots
:run
java -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -Xmx256M -cp .;../robocode.jar;../codesize.jar; roborumble.RoboRumbleAtHome ./roborumble/roborumble.txt
goto run
</pre>
After the BigCrash<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BigCrash" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, lots of clients (10 or more, and some new) where running the bots battles, and bots that access files (like <a href="robowiki@SS" class=wikipagelink>SS</a> &amp; <a href="robowiki@Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a>) can be disabled against enemies like <a href="robowiki@HawkOnFire" class=wikipagelink>HawkOnFire</a> &amp; other <a href="robowiki@HOT" class=wikipagelink>HOT</a> bots, what can have a very bad effect in the ranking...<br>
Since the rules of RR allows read/writing data, I think that we should all take a look at this issue. It isnt fair that clients run without that protection. Here is what i sugest us to do:<br>
<UL >
<li> Everybody running the clients, please certify that their .bats look like the above (with the "-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false").
<li> Someone (i dont know whom... probably <a href="robowiki@Albert" class=wikipagelink>Albert</a>, but i don´t have how to contact him.) please update those .bats (including the linux ones) to include this.

Please do set the user to your own name. This file works fine, but I suspect there is a minor bug in it. For each meleebattle each bot gets 18 battles fought instead of 9. Maybe an other meleebattlerunner could check it to be sure. Welcome (back) at the frightening world of melee!  -- <a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>
<UL >
<li> The reason it counts 18 instead of 9 is that it gets the same stats from two perspectives.  e.g. Ugluk wins (I wish) and submits scores against 9 competitors.  Each of the 9 competitors submits their own scores, including the same battle against Ugluk.  10 players, 90 two-way battles recorded.  It would be better if each successive bot did not submit scores for the ones ahead of them.  This would result in only 45 two-way battles recorded.  It really doesn't make a difference though .. it just takes twice the reported numbers to get as stable a ranking as the duelist rumble. --<a href="robowiki@Martin_Alan_Pedersen" class=wikipagelink>Martin Alan Pedersen</a>
<li> Alas it does make a difference, this is one of the reasons the meleeranking will never be as stable as the duelist rumble. One bad (or good) battle of your bot counts twice as hard, making the ranking much more 'jumpy'. Another reason for the 'not so stable' ranking is the random set of competitors you are facing, each with their weaknesses and strong points against any other competitor. This last reason is one of the charms of melee ;-)  --<a href="robowiki@GrubbmGait" class=wikipagelink>GrubbmGait</a>

I guess I may need to change my classpath, or I have the wrong version of robocode? - I would try a later version, but I'm 1.3.1 which is recommended for RR?

Welcome back ;) As for version, I use Robocode 1.1.3 for <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>. I can't remember if it's still on SourceForge<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=SourceForge" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, but I do remember I have it on my web space: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/robocode-setup-1.1.3.jar">[robocode-setup-1.1.3.jar]</a>. The newer versions have tons of great development options, but <a href="robowiki@Fnl" class=wikipagelink>Fnl</a> is still working on integrating the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> client into the main Robocode app. Also, it seems to me you should have backslashes in your -cp argument if you're on Windows, maybe that's the problem. I also usually put the whole classpath in quotes, but that might not matter. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
<p>
I sorted the above problem by placing robocode.jar in the robocode dir. That got me as far as, 
<pre>
Downloading ...ag.Gir 0.99
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: robocode.util.Utils.copy(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/io/File;)Z
</pre>
then swapping my classpath slashes around (well noticed ;P) gets me as far as;
<pre>
Downloading ...ag.Gir 0.99
</pre>
How long should it stay like that?
Ive also installed 1.1.3, and I get the same behaviour.

Ahh.. just seemingly random timeouts. It's working it's way through a list trying to download them, succeeding on a few. Sweet :)
<p>
The <a href="robowiki@RobocodeRepository" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeRepository</a> goes down a lot, that's the reason for all the timeouts. When it's down for long times, I actually edit BotsDownload<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BotsDownload" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.java and recompile so that it skips those bots, then I re-enable it later. Somewhere on the wiki is info on how to do that. Also somewhere on the wiki, someone has posted a .zip file with all the bots from sometime recently - you'd still need those updated since then, but it would help sav eyou some time. When I get home, maybe I'll have time to look around and give a little better info on where those pieces of info are =), or maybe someone else will chime in before then. Also, if you set your name in the Preferences, your updates will show up as you on the <a href="robowiki@Changes" class=wikipagelink>Changes</a> page. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

S'all working nicely now. I think I need to twiddle with BotsDownload<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BotsDownload" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.java . Cheers :) - hey, does this thing count failed conciousness checks? I hope not :/
<p>
The link to the zip file is here: <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble</a> -- <a href="robowiki@Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<p>
And the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> .class files that skip the repository: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dijitari.com/void/robocode/roborumble_norepository.zip">[roborumble_norepository.zip]</a>. The discussion and original link is on the <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a> page. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

So..I guess this is no longer a 'Temporary Server'... :) --<a href="robowiki@Starrynte" class=wikipagelink>Starrynte</a>
