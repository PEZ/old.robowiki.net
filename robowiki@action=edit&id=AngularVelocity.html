<textarea name="text"  rows="20" cols="65" wrap="virtual" style="width:100%">How many radians the opponent is moving relative to you per tick.

Equal to the enemy&#39;s lateral velocity divided by their distance from you.

Examples:

An enemy 100 units away is driving forwards perpendicular to you at 8 units / tick. They are going counterclockwise around you.  Their LateralVelocity is -8 since they are going counterclockwise. Their AngularVelocity is -.08.
*Velocity: 8.0
*LateralVelocity: -8.0
*AngularVelocity: -.08


An enemy 200 units away is driving backwards towards you at 8 units / tick. They are going clockwise around you. They are 30 degrees off from going straight at you. Their velocity is -8 since they are moving backwards.  Their LateralVelocity is +4, positive because they are moving clockwise and 4 because they are 30 degrees off from approaching you directly, and the sine of 30 degrees is .5. Their AngularVelocity is .02.
*Velocity: -8.0
*LateralVelocity: 4.0
*AngularVelocity: .02

How to calculate:

 Velocity: scannedRobotEvent.getVelocity()
 LateralVelocity: velocity * Math.sin(scannedRobotEvent.getHeadingRadians() - scannedRobotEvent.getBearingRadians() + getHeadingRadians())
 AngularVelocity: lateralVelocity / scannedRobotEvent.getDistance()

==== Questions ====
If you are segmenting on lateral velocity and distance already this isn&#39;t providng any more information, right? Well depending on the exact buckets I guess. But it could help reduce those two into one segementation (but not fully)? -- [[Pulsar]]

I don&#39;t really understand the question asked here. I doubt using angular velocity would really allow you to reduce segmentation though. If you don&#39;t have the distance segmentation there&#39;s instead the risk that you get quite polluted data buckets I think. -- [[PEZ]]

Well I wasn&#39;t very clear I guess. I&#39;m trying to concentrate on writing a bot but just end up reading more and more, testing and watching. Trying roborumble etc etc Then it&#39;s time for sleep and work :) Let me rephrase the question/statement evne though it&#39;s late and I might make it worse! Let&#39;s say you have your data segmented into distance and lateral velocity. If you would add a segment of let&#39;s say x=distance*latervelocity that would be meaningless as that is what you are already doing but even more segmented. Division should amount to the same thing, sort of. Am I making any sense? -- [[Pulsar]]

Yes, I totally agree. I tend to segment on primitive data and let the more sophisticated segmentations sort them self out in this matrix. Like I segment on velocity and last_tick_velocity instead of segmenting on acceleration. -- [[PEZ]]
