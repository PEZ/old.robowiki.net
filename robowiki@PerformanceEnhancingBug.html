Quote from the <a href="robowiki?Shadow" class=wikipagelink>Shadow</a> page: <em>Thanks, but I had to revert almost everything to 3.66 level. I found a huge bug in my recent attempt at "dynamic dimension weighting" that wasn't working as expected. Turns out that correcting that bug costs me at least 30 ranking points... talk about <a href="robowiki?PerformanceEnhancingBugs" class=wikipagelink>PerformanceEnhancingBugs</a>?! -- <a href="robowiki?ABC" class=wikipagelink>ABC</a></em>

Two examples from <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> (both before the full rewrite):
<UL >
<li> Until 0.945, Dooki's <a href="robowiki?WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> surfed waves until they passed his rear edge, but my Wave detection was off by 1 tick (though they lined up visually in graphical debugging). A bug in a new bot-width calculation (in 0.93) ended up calculating the bot width as almost 0 a lot of the time, which, I think, roughly compensated for the waves being off by 1 tick, and the rating went up. In the end, I fixed the off-by-1, fixed the bot-width calculation, and made the movement surf a wave until it was passed the center instead of the rear edge.
<li> <a href="robowiki?Dookious" class=wikipagelink>Dookious</a> 1.16 broke the 2100 barrier. At the time, I thought it was primarily because of the precise GF1/-1 calculations, which I do still think was a factor (as TC2K6 score went up a full point). During the full rewrite, I realized that a certain special case in my movement actually decreased performance; I then realized that special case was <em>broken</em> in the old code somewhere along the way; after checking, my suspicions were confirmed that the precise GF1 calculation is what had broken that. I'm pretty sure that was also a factor in the 8 point jump past 2100.
</UL>
