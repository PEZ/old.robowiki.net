<p>
My first "smart" bot. Simple randomized dodging algorithm and a very simple (my first) patternmatcher.
<p>
<H4>What's special about it?</H4>

<p>
My first smart bot? :P Focused on survival only. If you ask me the robot who still is in one peice when the dust clears is the winner.
<p>
<H4>Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?</H4>

<p>
<H4>How competitive is it?</H4>

<p>
Not very competitive at the moment. Its "old", though the first versions is more competitive because of bugs in the code ;)
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?Movement" class=wikipagelink>move</a>?</H4>

<p>
It doesnt. It only sits still waiting for the enemy to fire bullets to dodge.
<p>
<H4>How does it fire?</H4>

<p>
Uses a very simple pattern matcher combined with circular and linear targeting.
<p>
<H4>How does it <a href="robowiki?DodgingBullets" class=wikipagelink>dodge bullets</a>?</H4>

<p>
Keeps perpendicular to its enemy and reacts to enemy fire by randomizing distance to travel either forward or backward. Still got crappy wallavoidance. My wallavoidance algorithm is separated for general movement so sometimes (for good and bad) it does some funny things around the walls. :P 
<p>
One nice bug is that it mistakes some (note some) hits to be enemy fire and reacts accordingly giving an extra random varible when fighting.
<p>
<H4>How does the <a href="robowiki?Melee" class=wikipagelink>melee</a> strategy differ from <a href="robowiki?OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>one-on-one</a>  strategy?</H4>

<p>
Currently it doesnt have a melee strategy. only 1vs1.
<p>
<H4>What does it save between rounds and matches?</H4>

<p>
Nothing. Zip! Nada!!!!
<p>
<H4>Where did you get the name?</H4>

<p>
The idea behind Booring was to move as little as possible, thus have a very "Booring" play style.. though it ended up miving like crazy, but I kept the name still :)
<p>
<H4>Can I use your code?</H4>

<p>
Ehm... you don't wanna use my code... :P
<p>
<H4>What's next for your robot?</H4>

<p>
The scrapyard. Maybe I'll continue Boorings approach but right now it seems old and gone. Maybe fitting him with better guns would be cool, but I'm going for a new bot instead. 
<p>
<H4>Does it have any <a href="robowiki?WhiteWhale" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhale</a>s?</H4>

<p>
PrarieWolf<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=PrarieWolf" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and Sandbox DT. Was very focused on sandbox for a while and then suddenly it beat prariewolf when i tested it :) From then on its DT and lately Marshmallow who has ran past me during my absence lately. 
<p>
<H4>What other robot(s) is it based on?</H4>

<p>
Before beeing Booring I experimented with never released Jimp and Interceptor which both had different randomized movement. (same guns though).

<H4>Comments, questions, feedback:</H4>

Way cool! Booring was the first bot I really set out to beat. Back then it was the highest ranked Swedish bot (#44) and my goal was to make <a href="robowiki?Marshmallow" class=wikipagelink>Marshmallow</a> be the highest ranked Swedish bot. It took quite a while before I could outsurvive it though. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Hell yeah! :) And you beat it pretty easy too! I didn't know that this upcomer PEZ would be so dedicated ;) Just for fun try pitting your latest marshmallow against Booring version 1.0 ;) -- <a href="robowiki?Jimpa" class=wikipagelink>Jimpa</a>
