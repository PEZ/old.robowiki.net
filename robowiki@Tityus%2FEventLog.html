<li> January 3 2003 - Version 0.70 released
<UL >
<li> New movement, based on <a href="robowiki@Aristocles" class=wikipagelink>Aristocles</a>. Seems to not work as well as I had hoped. I can only get it flat on a 500-600 distance, even if it is <strong>very</strong> flat there. I'll scratch this movement now and try with a little more wall-bouncing one instead.
<li> The version number should have been 0.7.0, but I accidently deleted the last dot...
</UL>
<li> January 2 2003 - Tweaking movement again.
<UL >
<li> This time with a bugfixed (I hope) <a href="robowiki@RoboGrapherBot" class=wikipagelink>RoboGrapherBot</a>.
</UL>
<li> December 31 2003 - Version 0.6.2 released
<UL >
<li> Added a wall segment. This might give an edge against this or that bot, but probably slows learning too much. We'll see.
<li> <strong>Reference</strong> 0.6.1 placed #20 scoring 1800 points.
</UL>
<li> December 30 2003 - Version 0.6.1 released
<UL >
<li> Simplified the movement. And tweaked it some so it should be better than 0.6.0 (well, most movements are probably).
<li> <strong>Reference</strong> 0.6.0 placed #34 and scored 1754 points.
</UL>
<li> December 29 2003 - Version 0.6.0 released
<UL >
<li> I just couldn't revert back to 0.5.1 movement yet. Now trying a fluid motion instead. I got rid of all special cases.
<li> Releasing it pretty untweaked, to leave some room for improvement.
</UL>
<li> December 28 2003 - Ah, crap!
<UL >
<li> The simpler movement is crap. I don't know why it doesn't pay. It looks good in battle, but it's hard to tune a flat profile over all distances. and it is very, very vulnerable to lateral acceleration segmentation. I'll toss this movement and revert to 0.5.1. It sucks, but I did like the #20 position it had. =)
</UL>
<li> December 28 2003 - Working with a simpler version of the movement.
<UL >
<li> Still the same basic idea, but now I'm trying to remove all special cases. If I succeed the flatness should be easier to control.
</UL>
<li> December 27 2003 - Version 0.5.3 released.
<UL >
<li> I haven't manage to get the movement back to what 0.5.1 performed. But I refuse to go back there. It was too untidy and fragile.
</UL>
<li> December 27 2003 - Version 0.5.2 released.
<UL >
<li> I made some rather heavy changes to the movement and added a segmentation for the gun. I'm not sure which change causes most trouble, but either or both changes made Tityus drop 30 positions on the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> ladder...
<li> <strong>Reference</strong> - 0.5.1 placed #20 and scored 1802 points.
</UL>
<li> December 26 2003 - Version 0.5.1 released.
<UL >
<li> Movement tweaking and some targeting adjustment and energy management tweaks.
<li> <strong>Reference</strong> - 0.5.0 placed #22 in <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> with 1781 points.
</UL>
<li> December 26 2003 - Version 0.5.0 released.
<UL >
<li> Fixed huge targeting bug. Thanks <a href="robowiki@Jamougha" class=wikipagelink>Jamougha</a>!
<li> Simplyfied movement some.
</UL>
<li> November 10 2003 - Version 0.4.4 released.
<UL >
<li> The top bots all eat this Tityus for lunch. I don't know what to do about it though.
<li> The colors are back
</UL>
<li> November 3 2003 - Version 0.4 released
<UL >
<li> A completely new movement (for Tityus that is, I'm pretty sure it's not unique). It's actually one of my first movement ideas that I have realized for the first time.
</UL>
<li> September 11 2003 - Version 0.3.1 released
<UL >
<li> A tewaked <a href="robowiki@Gouldingi" class=wikipagelink>Gouldingi</a> 1.4 style movement.
<li> Agressive rammer.
</UL>
<li> August 19 2003 - Version 0.3 released
<UL >
<li> Bug fixes in the gun
<li> Some energy management strategy added
</UL>
</UL>
