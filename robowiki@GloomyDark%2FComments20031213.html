Nice bot!  You are quiet close to DT:

GD beat DT on bullet damage, it's just the survival that's not too good.  A little tweaking and you might force paul into an update. -- <a href="robowiki?Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Is that from a 1000 round battle? I was going to say it was just luck, but not with that many rounds. Cool, but still not close enough. DT is a survivalist bot and thus sacrifices bullet damage for survival, and does it extremely well. <a href="robowiki?Marshmallow" class=wikipagelink>Marshmallow</a> used to always beat DT clearly in bullet damage, but over 1000 rounds always lost in total score. Of course that was earlier DTs. M doesn't have much of a say against DT 2.11. I'm glad GD looses with some face left. =) Thanks for posting those results. I have been running much shorter matches and only have tested long battles against <a href="robowiki?Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>'s and <a href="robowiki?Iiley" class=wikipagelink>iiley</a>'s bots. DT feels a bit unreachable for me at the time. 2.11 is such a strong bot that I almost doubt I can do anything about it. Almost. I <strong>will</strong> try! -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
I wonder what drm.Magazine does that DT doesn't like... And <a href="robowiki?GB" class=wikipagelink>GB</a>, the strangest bot ever I think, seems to score better than Gloomy against DT too. I wonder if GB could beat DT if I give it a mirroring movement. Wait, I can try that. =) -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Yes, it was 1000 rounds.  I was also wondering what was happening with Magazine... -- <a href="robowiki?Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
I'm just running 1000 rounds of DT vs Magazine... it doesn't look like it was a fluke... DT doesn't seem to be able to hit it... -- <a href="robowiki?Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>

<p>
Those are very <a href="robowiki?SlowBots" class=wikipagelink>SlowBots</a>... that was less than 500 rounds and took ages...  it looks like DT takes a long time to learn how to hit Magazine, but once it does, it is fine.  That's the problem with small battles. -- <a href="robowiki?Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
That's interesting. In <a href="robowiki?RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home teh chances that DT and Magazine meet twice on the same client are minimal. Which means, that with a movement like Magazine, which DT seems to have trouble figuring out quick enough you can beat DT. Magazine obviously does. =) My test with using <a href="robowiki?MirrorMovement" class=wikipagelink>MirrorMovement</a> in <a href="robowiki?GB" class=wikipagelink>GB</a> didn't work out all that well though. It seems like its old movement was what DT has problems with, not its guns. Nevertheless I'll release this mirroring GB since it is a crap bot anyways. =) Funny that if you use a <a href="robowiki?GoToBot" class=wikipagelink>GoToBot</a> mirroring is as easy as:<pre>goTo(new Point2D.Double(centerX - (enemyLocation.getX() - centerX), centerY - (enemyLocation.getY() - centerY)));</pre>I stole the code from Marshmallow's AntiMirroringTargeting<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=AntiMirroringTargeting" class=wikipageedit>?</a> gun. (Which uses M's future position instead of enemyLocation of course). -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Wow... Already someone using my graphing utility. :D - That's an excellent looking curve PEZ, it's very flat and spread out; curve flattening targeting bots (Fractal especially, quite obviously from the graph) will have a lot of trouble hitting it. Very nice. -- <a href="robowiki?Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a>
<p>
Thanks for those words. I had actually hoped it would make a bigger difference with this tuned movement. But it hasn't exactly soared through the rankings yet. The automatic movement adapter (DT style) isn't in operation yet, since I can't get it to not wreak havoc. Maybe with that in place I can do some real kick-ass curve flattening. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
