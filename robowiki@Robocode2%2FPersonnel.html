<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Want to help with <a href="robowiki?Robocode2" class=wikipagelink>Robocode2</a>?? Cant wait for someone else to do it?? Have far too much free time? Mad enough to sign up when the project is still really a dream, and we dont even have RC1 source to work from? Well, you've come to the right place. Put your name &amp; skills down here, and if it does become reality, then be prepared for lots of programming! :)
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Wolfman" class=wikipagelink>Wolfman</a> - 3 years Java experience, but never wielded it in anger in a commercial sense. :)
<p>
<a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a> - My writing skills could be put to use in writing user documentation. I also have 12 years experience of designing the user view of computer software so I can maybe help with keeping the user interface clean and to the point. My Java experience limits to the two months I have been Robocoding.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Insectoid" class=wikipagelink>Insectoid</a> I could help debug, and possibly help all-around. This ISN'T a guarentee, beacause I'm a middle schooler.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Ray_Vermette" class=wikipagelink>Ray Vermette</a> If this gets off the ground, you'll need debuggers and code documentation -- I can help with both.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Nano" class=wikipagelink>nano</a> - I have 4 years experience with Java, as well as a good knowledge of design patterns, and I think I should be able to help with API specifications and implementation.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Hexkid" class=wikipagelink>hexkid</a> - I would love to be involved.  I have 6 years commercial Java experience (mainly server-side) and Sun Certified Programmer &amp; Developer.  Haven't had a lot of involvement in Robocode since the rumble.
<p>
FraG<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=FraG" class=wikipageedit>?</a> - I am a commercial Java software developer since december 1997 (Client, Server, Browser, 2D-Graphics, GUI, ...). If I can find enough spare time, it would be great to be a robocode 2 code contributor.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Bienator" class=wikipagelink>bienator</a> - I have not commercial Java experience, but I have written an 3D engine in Java3D for Robocode. If someone wants an additional 3D realtime renderer as alternative to the 2D output, I think I can help.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?ElimiNate" class=wikipagelink>ElimiNate</a> - I got involved with robocode last year and loved it.  I would like to be involved with the defining and implementing RobocodeII<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=RobocodeII" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. I have a BS in CS and have been doing java based server-side development for about 5 years.  I would like to take Robocode to a new level where strategy plays more of a role than exploiting the limits of the system.  I also can help with web development support stuff - HTML, PHP, MySQL<a href="robowiki?action=edit&id=MySQL" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, CMS stuff etc.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Vuen" class=wikipagelink>Vuen</a> - Very cool. I have only a year of Java experience under my belt, and only from Robocode robots; I've played around with my own apps with Swing UI and Java3D and stuff, but never really made a serious application. I'd love to help out, and build some <a href="robowiki?Robocode2" class=wikipagelink>Robocode2</a> robots :)
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Mje" class=wikipagelink>mje</a> - commercial java developer &amp; architect since 1997, skills in distributed, embedded Java, gui, j2me. In 2000 I've done a small distributed robotic simulation environment. Ever thougt about building an distributed robocode ? I think there would be some advantages :-).
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Vic_Stewart" class=wikipagelink>Vic Stewart</a> - 2 years of Java experience, 4 years of C++/OO-design experience. XML/XSL-T, CVS, SQL, Sourceforge project administration..... I could be helpful for coding, design and administering the project at SF.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Axe" class=wikipagelink>Axe</a> - 4 years of Java experience, Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform 1.4 since july 2003, I'm starting learning UML using Rose tools &amp; also starting the exam for the Java Developer Certify. Programming since i was 10 years old (assembler Z80), i'm a fanatic about programming. Robocoder since jan. 2003, i'm new in this stuff but just loving it, I offer my services for anything that could help Robocode community. 
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Sven_Claeys" class=wikipagelink>Sven Claeys</a> - 4 years programming experience, with 1 year of (basic) Java experience. Can help best with (but not limited to): testing/debuging,  writing documentation, software/documentation localization (translating english-&gt;dutch).
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Synnalagma" class=wikipagelink>Synnalagma</a> - I have some experience with java, Prolog and C++(on Linux) developpment. I also have some understanding of the current Robocode architecture.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?Tiernan" class=wikipagelink>Tiernan</a> - I have experience with distributed computing.  I am currently working as an Architect at a company doing J2EE development.  In addition to Java I am comfortable in Perl, Python, Ruby, C++, and C.  I am particulary interested in making it possible to write robots in different languages.  I also believe that it is wise to support distributed combat in Robocode 2.
<p>
<a href="robowiki?SirNuke" class=wikipagelink>SirNuke</a> - I have been doing 'serious' programming since middle school, have three years of Java through my own work and High School classes. I also do php/mysql, several BASIC compilers, linux, and some C.  I have quite a bit of free time right now (and probubally for the next year or so until College interups everything :-)
<p>
Nuke, I think the Robocode2 effort (which never was) will shift fully for <a href="robowiki?OpenSourceRobocode" class=wikipagelink>OpenSourceRobocode</a> instead. You should make your skills and time available to <a href="robowiki?MatNelson" class=wikipagelink>MatNelson</a> who will start the sourceforge site before this month's (feb 2005) end. -- <a href="robowiki?PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
