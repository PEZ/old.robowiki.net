Hey, nice to see that you're already aiming for the crown ;) ... Curious as to how you could combine the <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> movement with <a href="robowiki@FunkyChicken" class=wikipagelink>FunkyChicken</a>, I took a look at the source, and wanted to point something out to you. It looks like you are making some calls to setTurnRight<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=TurnRight" class=wikipageedit>?</a>() early on in the on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> event, but when <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a>'s doSurfing() method is called, the movement code it executes will override the previous setXXX stuff. From looking at your source, I think that only the <a href="robowiki@BasicSurfer" class=wikipagelink>BasicSurfer</a> movement is having an effect.
<p>
The <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> stats are processed by a distributed client, so take a look at <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble/StartingWithRoboRumble</a> if you want to have some control over the processing of your tank in the competition. Good luck,
<p>

Welcome to the wiki. It sounds like you're off to a good start with Python, most Robocoders don't even go near <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> when they're starting out. The repository seems to be down right now, so it might be a little while before any results get posted. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
Hey man, a couple things you should probably know:
<UL >
<li> Your bot is not getting run in the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> because the version on the participants page, the version listed on the <a href="robowiki@RobocodeRepository" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeRepository</a>, and the actual version of the bot in the .jar are all different ('b', 'Beta', and 'g', respectively). Those should all be the same version. By logging in, you can upload new versions of your bot to the repository instead of creating new entries for each one.
<li> The "setMaxVelocity<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MaxVelocity" class=wikipageedit>?</a>" stuff may have some effect on how an enemy gun learns your bot's movement, but it also makes the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a>'s <a href="robowiki@PrecisePrediction" class=wikipagelink>PrecisePrediction</a> completely inaccurate. You might want to run tests both ways, or figure out a way to decide beforehand when you'll change velocities, and predict that, too.
<li> Be careful what you say about "almost beating <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a>" =) Not that you should worry about beating such a superb bot yet, anyway. This is what I got when running a standard 35-round match (the length used in the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>):
</UL>

OK Python is officially much better without the <a href="robowiki@VelocityTrick" class=wikipagelink>VelocityTrick</a> What i meant by almost beat <a href="robowiki@CassiusClay" class=wikipagelink>CassiusClay</a> was by life, not by entire battle. Sorry for the confusion, and sorry I'm kinda bad at that sort of stuff. Also I THINK I fixed the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> thing.
-- <a href="robowiki@Xero" class=wikipagelink>Xero</a>
<p>
OK, I fixed Python's entry in the Participants list (you needed to put the version number with the name). My client just began processing it, so you should see some results up very soon. Also, I think it was a good idea to take out your velocity trick. A <a href="robowiki@PrecisePrediction" class=wikipagelink>PrecisePrediction</a> <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> system is very delicate. If something (ie random velocity changes) is throwing off its predictions by even a little bit it will not work near its potential. Anyway, good luck with Python. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
In reference to your request at the top of the page:
I havn't had time to look at your code (been coding for classes all day), but if you want to use randomized velocity changes and still have working surfing you'll have to do what Voidious posted earlier; determine when and by how much you want to change velocity ahead of time and factor those changes into the <a href="robowiki@PrecisePrediction" class=wikipagelink>PrecisePrediction</a> calculations. --<a href="robowiki@Wcsv" class=wikipagelink>wcsv</a>
<p>
I made the velocity changes less frequent so the wavesurfing should have time to mess around. It gets 100 ticks for itself before any changes in velocity happen.Pattern: Surf, velocity change, surf, velocity change. Every 100 ticks it goes to the next thing. Not perfect, still, but works a little better. -- <a href="robowiki@Xero" class=wikipagelink>Xero</a>
<p>
Well, the thing is that the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> algorithm chooses which direction to orbit in based on the assumption that max velocity is 8. It could be altered to take a different maximum velocity into account if you wanted. But if you change the max velocity and the <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> isn't aware of it, it's really just acting more like <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> - not that that's entirely bad. But the true power of <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> shines through in a flawless implementation, so you might want to decide if <a href="robowiki@WaveSurfing" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurfing</a> or <a href="robowiki@RandomMovement" class=wikipagelink>RandomMovement</a> is what you're really going for. -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>

<li>Remember, a LOT of people in the rumble have put in many, many hours to develop a strong bot. I'd wager that no one in the top 100 placed a bot there without some serious thought. With that in mind, be patient. See what you can learn over time. Don't try to do it all at once.
<li>Regarding <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>, the best way to learn is to approach it in a way that makes sense to YOU. No one can say exactly what that means; but for instance, think of your opponent moving in one dimension: either right or left relative to you. Don't worry about anything else. As a first step toward <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a>, keep track of the angle your opponent likes to move either right or left. Store that information. Now, when you fire, determine their favorite right or left angle and shoot! I'm purposely leaving out technical details because I think they can be more confusing than useful. Think about the problem without tutorials. You'll soon realize that the right or left question is heavily dependent on which direction they're already traveling. If they're moving right, they're more likely to continue moving right. The same applies for left. This exposes the need to 'qualify' an observation based on what your opponent is currently doing. It's the basis of <a href="robowiki@Segmentation" class=wikipagelink>Segmentation</a>. Resist the urge to read that page. Instead, think of how you can 'qualify' your observations. What influences your opponents decision to move right or left? As you answer this question, make it part of your decision to aim right or left and by how much.
</OL>
<p>
If you think targeting is hard, consider the folly of unwinding the whole thing to determine where NOT to move.  --<a href="robowiki@Corbos" class=wikipagelink>Corbos</a>
<p>
The way I think about guess factors is:
<OL >
<li> I only consider the opponents lateral movement orbiting me.
<li> I think of the opponents current movement direction as <em>forwards</em>.
<li> Thus the other movement direction is <em>reverse</em>.
</OL>
<p>
<strong>When collecting statistics</strong> I note, for each <a href="robowiki@Wave" class=wikipagelink>Wave</a> that reaches the opponent, how far in either the forwards or reverse direction the opponent traveled. Say maximum forward is 100% and maximum reverse is -100%. I chop that up in bins of an array where index 0 means -100% and index BINS-1 means 100%.
<p>
<strong>When firing</strong> I check what bin is most used and convert it to a bearing for my gun.
<p>
I hope this makes some sense.

<p>
<a href="robowiki@Mako" class=wikipagelink>Mako</a> saves data between matches, I think, so that might give him a leg up on Python in multiple matches. Also, <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a> matches are 35 rounds, not 10, so that gives a learning gun a lot more time to zero in on your movement. (You can still learn things from longer or shorter matches in testing, though, for sure.) -- <a href="robowiki@Voidious" class=wikipagelink>Voidious</a>
