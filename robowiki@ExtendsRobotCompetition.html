<H4>Next competition is scheduled for whenever a new bot is submitted or updated.</H4>

<p>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
This is a new tournament to exclude the likes of DT and all those other AdvancedRobots<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=AdvancedRobots" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. The only requirement to enter is that your bot must extend Robot. I'll run the first tournament next weekend. Stay tuned for further competition details. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
OK, I've set up the <a href="robowiki@OneOnOne" class=wikipagelink>OneOnOne</a> format, comments welcome. Melee is a bit more complicated if I'm going to do it elimination-style. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a> 
<p>
<hr noshade class=wikiline size=1>
<p>
Hmmm... radar's going to be difficult... movement and firing should be doable though. -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
To help people transition, I've written <a href="robowiki@ExtendsRobotCompetition/RadiansRobot" class=wikipagelink>/RadiansRobot</a>
<p>
I'll be entering this, sounds fun! --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Added some sample bots, if you don't mind. What's the format of the competition? Single elimination like Face2Face, seasons like the MinibotChallenge<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MinibotChallenge" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, something else? --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
What about Melee? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Melee would be fun too, I'll enter the melee competition too if Alcatraz runs one.  --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
I was going to use the tournament version of <a href="robowiki@RoboLeague" class=wikipagelink>RoboLeague</a> like the <a href="robowiki@MiniBot" class=wikipagelink>MiniBot</a> Challenge, but I can't get it working for some reason. I do plan on doing both 1vs1 (800x600) and melee (1000x1000, 10 competitors). But since there hasn't been any single elimination tournaments in awhile and those are fun, I may do that. Probably 100 rounds. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
<pre>
1st: sample.Walls	10367	4950	990	3635	725	67	0	99	1	0
2nd: dft.Krazy 1.1	2118	50	10	2013	20	23	0	1	99	0
</pre>
Better do something about that before the competition... ;-) --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Yeah, yeah... nothing like Walls to expose your head-on targetting. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
I'm happy someone else noticed the huge gap between Robot and <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>! Maybe i'll code something worthy for this now ... AdvancedRobots<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=AdvancedRobots" class=wikipageedit>?</a> are evil &gt;:( -- <a href="robowiki@Qetu" class=wikipagelink>Qetu</a>
<p>
There's an Irish national Robocode tournament for Robots, funnily enough.  I just added the #2 to the rumble and melee rumble.  Beats Krazy, looses to <a href="robowiki@SpinBot" class=wikipagelink>SpinBot</a>.  I'll see if I can track down the winners and get them to put up their bot too. -- <a href="robowiki@Jamougha" class=wikipagelink>Jamougha</a>
<p>
i'm going to make a robot, but probably not untill the last minute so that no one can test against it and because of time constraints with school and track and whatnot. --<a href="robowiki@Andrew" class=wikipagelink>andrew</a>
<p>
<p>
"The first season will run on 13 March 2004..." - did it run? If not, when will the first one be, and more importantly, what's the deadline for entering? --<a href="robowiki@David_Alves" class=wikipagelink>David Alves</a>
<p>
Oops, I meant the 20th. Deadline shall be 10 AM EST. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Just added cf.robot.Dot .  hope you havent started the competition. If you have i will have to wait for 2. season --<a href="robowiki@Deathcon" class=wikipagelink>deathcon</a> 
<p>
Not according to his deadline, it's a bit before 8 AM EST right now. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
Sure i think its about 14 AM CEST --<a href="robowiki@Deathcon" class=wikipagelink>deathcon</a>
<p>
Alright, competition is starting now. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Results of season 1 are up, sure goes fast with only 8 competitiors. I want to know where Ralph was, because Krazy shouldn't have won. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Ahhhhhh crap, missed it. Had to avoid robocode and sleep in order to meet deadlines for friday, after that i pretty much crashed and forgot to enter. Got 4 weeks of nothingness to fill, so expect a strong entry next time out... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
I look forward to seeing it. I also look forward to seeing something by David, it seems like he might be planning something. Competition is really fast to run, so I'm going to do another tomorrow. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Don't forget to include Girl in there, too, then.  I just basically threw it together from code I mostly already had.  I think it will do well (at least it will give you guys something to try and beat).  Maybe in melee (right now you could basically put them all in one battle) you could have the bottom five robots be eliminated? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Nuts, i somehow managed to lose all my Ralph code and now i cant get the gun to work. Looks liek it could be a long night. When do you want Ralph by for tomorrows competition?? --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
I just made a new movement, here's ralph with head-on targetting:
<pre>
1st: brainfade.Ralph	10048	3850	770	4649	778	1	0	77	23	0
2nd: dft.Krazy 1.21	6639	1150	230	4882	373	3	0	23	77	0
</pre>
Anyhow, back to fixing the gun...--<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
Haha, i know what the bug is. With an "extend Robot" bot it is futile trying to implement any kind of radar lock. Having spent hours changing things around to try and get one, it turns out that you only scan when you arent doing anything else. Don't know if everyone else apart from me was aware of that. Frustrating... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
"Hmmm... radar's going to be difficult... movement and firing should be doable though." - wasn't that basically the first post on this page?  <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a> just spins her radar between motions.  It seems that you can get around some of the limitations by doing stuff in on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> (like PEZ's <a href="robowiki@WallsPoet" class=wikipagelink>WallsPoet</a> - it spins its gun infinitely and moves in on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> - but the movement doesn't stop the gun from turning.  Kind of interesting). -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Hmmm... I never thought of using events like that, that deserves investigating... IIRC <a href="robowiki@CustomEvents" class=wikipagelink>CustomEvents</a> are in <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>, which limits the usefulness a little, because doing stuff in on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> only really works if you can scan every tick. Still, I'll look into it. -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
"Works" depends on what you do there I guess. Custom events seem to be an advanced concept so it belongs in <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a>. in'it? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Thinking about it. Shouldn't it be possible to use threads to control your Robot? Make your own setXXX() and execute() methods and thus create much of what's in <a href="robowiki@AdvancedRobot" class=wikipagelink>AdvancedRobot</a> only with immunity against wall hits. Just a thought. Haven't really looked into the implementation details. -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Yes, that ought to work.  The calls would only block the thread they were called from, leaving your other threads to get on with whatever they have to do.  I'm not sure it's in the spirit of the competition, but I think someone should try it anyway. (If everyone starts doing it it defeats the point of the competition and we will have to make a NoThreads<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=NoThreads" class=wikipageedit>?</a> rule.) -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Well, I'm thinking of it as useful outside this particular competition. =) -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
The wall issue?  You could well be right... -- <a href="robowiki@Tango" class=wikipagelink>Tango</a>
<p>
Competition in 20 minutes, still accepting submissions. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Alright, check out those results ;-)  How does it feel to be beaten by a <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a>? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
I tried to make a Robot version of a stat gun using events, I had a radar lock and didn't block more than a tick from on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> or run, but I found when my move went off (in various bullet and robot hit events) it blocked my radar anyway. So that trick is of limited usefulness. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
A <a href="robowiki@PatternMatcher" class=wikipagelink>PatternMatcher</a> should work well. --<a href="robowiki@Deathcon" class=wikipagelink>deathcon</a>
<p>
The problem is that a pattern-matcher which can go without scans at arbitrary times is a little harder to implement. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Yeah, a stat gun is alot easier, if you miss a few ticks on a stat gun it's no big deal, if you miss them on a PM it's going to be a big pain. Unless, as Kawigi implied, you miss the same number of ticks consistently on the PM, then it's a bit more useful (like a melee PM that sees every 8th movement), but being consistent in the amount of time missed on a Robot is pretty hard unless you're always making the same length movements, scans, etc. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
Right.  Although I'll have to mess around with a more <a href="robowiki@WallsPoet" class=wikipagelink>WallsPoet</a>-ish approach maybe.  If my radar could spin without blocking movement/gun turning, it would be nicer :-)  One thing I imply with the stat gun, too, is that the erratic scanning makes my technique of interpolating position for missed scans even more effective. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Yeah, I call the update code iteratively and interpolate the past positions. The problem I had was that the stuff in on<a href="robowiki@ScannedRobot" class=wikipagelink>ScannedRobot</a> and run stopped going once other events went off, so it'd be locking radar, then it'd go to move and the radar would freeze. The funny part is that movement and turning would happen at the same time, it'd make arcs, it just refused to also scan (regardless of if it was making an arc or not). :p I have a few more ideas to play around with before I discard it, but it seems like it may be a dead end. -- <a href="robowiki@Kuuran" class=wikipagelink>Kuuran</a>
<p>
Sorry alcatraz, i'm gonna have to bail on you again. The combination of the football and the nice weather means my mind has been on things other than robocode, and i havent even started re-coding Ralph. I'm busy all tomorrow, so i wont get it done for sunday. I'll have him finished for the one after i promise... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
Alright, that's fine. I'll just run the one with Deep7. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Just remember Deep7 was my fist attempt at robocode, against your bots it may be a little weak. -- <a href="robowiki@Chuculain" class=wikipagelink>Chuculain</a>
<p>
Finished running the competition. Kawigi's Girl won again, in both melee and 1v1. Deep7 was runner-up in melee, congrats Chuculain. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Which leaves me with the question, is it worth my time to upgrade <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a> to make sure I stay ahead or should I just keep waiting for someone to really challenge it?  Also, I think <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a>'s round 1 score against <a href="robowiki@Krazy" class=wikipagelink>Krazy</a> is a typo. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Congrats Kawigi. Really strong robot you have there. I will have to update Dot, but at the moment  i need all my free time to work on my advanced robots. --<a href="robowiki@Deathcon" class=wikipagelink>deathcon</a>
<p>
Yeah good call Kawigi, typo there. I think I've got a challenge for you. Krazy 1.4 beats Girl in my 1v1 tests. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Just finished up tonight's competition. The next one is scheduled for Friday, and it will be the last one until a new competitor is entered. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
In typical style, i won't have an entrant ready for this competition. Despite having laid down some code Ralph is far from battle ready. I'm shooting back off down south later on today for an interview and will be staying there till next Friday, and unfortuantely i won't have my puter with me. As an interesting sidenote, looking through the list of applicants, one of them is Alisdair Owens (of Nicator and <a href="robowiki@SnippetBot" class=wikipagelink>SnippetBot</a> fame). Small world in'it... --<a href="robowiki@Brainfade" class=wikipagelink>Brainfade</a>
<p>
Wow! Can't you try interest Alisdair for Robocoding again? -- <a href="robowiki@PEZ" class=wikipagelink>PEZ</a>
<p>
Girl 1.1 should send <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a> back to the drawing board... -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
I'll see what I can do about running the next competition. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
I finally uploaded the results to the most recent competition. Melee froze a couple of times and I never fixed it, but I don't think that matters because Girl would've won again. Let's have some more entrants, people! There's been very little talk on the wiki recently. Are you all plotting how to make a kick ass Robot? -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Cool. Looks like I get to run this again, finally. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Where are you posting the results? -- <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
<strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.squarefuse.com/robocode.htm">http://www.squarefuse.com/robocode.htm</a></strong> Unfortunately, <a href="robowiki@UnderDark3" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark3</a> didn't make it out of the first round. But hopefully a few more updates and you can beat Girl. No one else has been able to do that so far. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Are you going to run a melee? --<a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
Yes, either later tonight or tomorrow. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
I ran another one on one competition and uploaded the melee results from last time. Girl won again, as usual, but <a href="robowiki@UnderDark3" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark3</a> placed second in one one one. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
That is what I expected(Losing to Girl) --<a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
Yep, that's pretty much how it is for every Robot. But I'll run another tourney tomorrow to see if my newest <a href="robowiki@Krazy" class=wikipagelink>Krazy</a> can beat it. I tweaked the guess factor gun a bit, simplified it, actually. Also, I've noticed that UD3 gets stuck in the corners a lot. You might want to look into that. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Another competition run, and a very close match in the finals. --<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
04/06/05: I finally ran another competition. Hopefully in the next one there will be a new <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a>? -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Shouldn't the top 3 in one-on-one have been Krazy, Girl and <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Are you going to run a melee? --<a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
Yes, yes it should have been. Those were the results from the last tournament. And I don't think I'm going to run a melee. All it is at the moment is 100 rounds of the 10 bots entered in the competition, and that doesn't seem very tournament-esque. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
To run a tournament-style melle: take the 8 competitors put into two matches of 4 each on a 2k X 2k field.  Then take the 1st and 2nd place bots from each melle, and put into a 3 "finals" melle.  Run all melles for ~25 rounds --<a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
Well, I sort of did what you suggested, but 4 each on a 1000x800 field because that's my favorite size and there aren't any competitions that use that. Girl won, of course. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
The dynamics are quite interesting compared to a standard 10-bot battle.  Krazy seems to do relatively well (or maybe IndustryStandard<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=IndustryStandard" class=wikipageedit>?</a> does relatively badly) in 4-bot battles. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Ran another competition. The new <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a> did not fare so well. Also, even in traditional battles, Krazy still does ok (but only against other robots, of course). -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
4-17-05: Finished another competition. <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a> got unfortunately paired with Girl in the first rounds, but still performed decently. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
It looks like <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a> 1.2 has its traditional 3 wins now, is the next tournament featuring <a href="robowiki@Krazy" class=wikipagelink>Krazy</a> 1.6? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Well, I spent the afternoon writing a robot that would <a href="robowiki@WaveSurf" class=wikipagelink>WaveSurf</a>, but then I realized that robots spend such a long time at GF 0 anyway that it's almost irrelevant. Plus I suspect that it was also broken... -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
5-9-05: I seem to remember hearing that one of these was going on last weekend - status update, <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>? -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
Yes, Girl won, <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a> was second, I have not run melee, I am busy, 10 days of school left, I will post it by the end of this week... -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Sounds like you need automatic results generation and uploading like the RLL ;-) (of course the benefit for the RLL is much higher, since it ran its 75th tournament last week) -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
OK, I got the results up. Girl defeated <a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a> in the finals. NanoKing<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=NanoKing" class=wikipageedit>?</a> lost in the first round. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Hi everyone.. <a href="robowiki@Chuculain" class=wikipagelink>Chuculain</a> here, been out of commision for some time. But the summer (laughs to himself) is here I wonder if this extends robot comp is still alive?
<p>
I should think that Alcatraz is still doing this and I would also like to enter soon. You can always try sending him an e-mail if no one else responds to your question. -- <a href="robowiki@Kinsen" class=wikipagelink>Kinsen</a>
<p>
<a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a> mentioned to me he's planning on running another tournament probably in the next week with the new <a href="robowiki@UnderDark3" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark3</a> version.  Of course maybe he was just trying not to sound like a wimp after asking me if the <a href="robowiki@RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> is going on this weekend. -- <a href="robowiki@Kawigi" class=wikipagelink>Kawigi</a>
<p>
The <a href="robowiki@RobocodeLittleLeague" class=wikipagelink>RobocodeLittleLeague</a> motivates me to run the ERC. Without it the last two weeks I was reduced to apathy... really though I'm apathetic anyway. I actually have a half-finished tournament from last month still to post, and I really will run a new one either tonight or tomorrow. I hope to see new bots from y'all soon. (And one from me so that Kawigi can have some work to do.) -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Well, the first unpredictable thing in the history of the competition happened - <a href="robowiki@Krazy" class=wikipagelink>Krazy</a> beat <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a> in the finals. Definitely a fluke, as it's the only time I've seen that happen with these two versions. <a href="robowiki@Girl" class=wikipagelink>Girl</a> won the skirmish, of course. -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
<p>
Is this competition still active? --<a href="robowiki@UnderDark" class=wikipagelink>UnderDark</a>
<p>
Sorry, I've been playing Civilization IV in what free time I have now. Will try to run a tournament... -- <a href="robowiki@Alcatraz" class=wikipagelink>Alcatraz</a>
