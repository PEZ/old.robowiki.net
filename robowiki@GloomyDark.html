What's new?
<p>
<p>
<UL >
<li> December 17 2003 - Version 0.9.1 released
<UL >
<li> Tweaked movement. No testing at all so it could be much worse than before. =)
</UL>
<li> December 13 2003 - Version 0.9 released
<UL >
<li> This is a Swiffer with just one movement mode; what was originally Tityus' movement.
<li> I tired of hunting bugs in the old gunning system so it is Swiffer's gun for me a while now.
<li> The movement still has some bugs I need iron out. You can see it often getting stuck along the walls near corners. Making it an easy target for bots segmenting on this.
</UL>
<li> December 7 2003 - Version 0.5 released
<UL >
<li> I just can't find what's wrong. But something is wrong. Gloomy can't hit its enemies. Releasing it just to get a new reference ranking. -- PEZ
</UL>
<li> November 17 2003 - Version 0.5g released
<UL >
<li> "g" stands for "gamma" and is there because something is seriously wrong with this robot. I suspect it's the targeting, but I can't find the bug. I'm entering it to get some motivation to fix it. I don't think I can stand a rank #100 for GD for very long. =) -- PEZ
</UL>
<li> November 3 2003 - Version 0.4 released
<li> November 2 2003 - Version 0.4 about to be released
<UL >
<li> Jim told me he had noticed that Marshmallow's movement is pretty flat viewed from Jekyl's and <a href="robowiki@FloodMini" class=wikipagelink>FloodMini</a>'s perspective. The irony of this is huge since it was the movement I deserted when locking myself into the <a href="robowiki@MovementLaboratory" class=wikipagelink>MovementLaboratory</a> for several months. I decided to try Marshmallow's movement in Gloomy. I actually had to decompile Marshmallow for this since my CVS repository didn't have the released code of M 1.9. I can't get it to create the same profile as with M 1.9 though, which is strange, but it's still better than the current Gloomy movement.
<li> There's a lot of experimental code in this version, and my hopes is that some of the concepts I try out will prove themselves in real combat.
</UL>
<li> October 3 2003 - Version 0.3 released
<UL >
<li> Jim has handed me some findings of his that breathes more hope into my movement experiments. This version is totally untested, but it has an interesting movement profile.
<li> Also it does a <a href="robowiki@VertiLeach" class=wikipagelink>VertiLeach</a> and tries to fixate the fighting distance and keeps it's segmentation small.
</UL>
<li> September 23 2003 - Version 0.2 released
<UL >
<li> Tweaked movement
<li> Some bug fixes in strategy code
</UL>
<li> September 19 2003 - First test version (0.1) released
</UL>
<p>
What's special about it?
<p>
<p>
<UL >
<li> It's Gloomy and it's Dark
</UL>
<p>
Great, I want to try it. Where can I download it?

<p>
How competitive is it?
<p>
<p>
Let the <a href="robowiki@RoboRumble" class=wikipagelink>RoboRumble</a>@Home tell that story:
<UL >
<li> [Current ranking] - [Details]
</UL>
<p>
How does it move?
<p>
<p>
Random lateral movement. Trying to smooth somewhat along the walls.
<p>
How does it fire?
<p>
<p>
A segmented <a href="robowiki@GuessFactorTargeting" class=wikipagelink>GuessFactorTargeting</a> gun. 
<p>
How does it dodge bullets?
<p>
<p>
No dodging here. Just moving as randomly as I know how to.
<p>
How does the melee strategy differ from one-on-one strategy?
<p>
<p>
This bot doesn't know about Melee battles.
<p>
What does it save between rounds and matches?
<p>
<p>
A <a href="robowiki@CribSheet" class=wikipagelink>CribSheet</a> of the best guess factor in each segment bucket. Each enemy file is only 112 bytes. Here's the <a href="robowiki@CribSheet" class=wikipagelink>CribSheet</a> for Quest 0.10:
<p>
)"&amp;00'%//10&amp;%%0001#%/000003001',+000'0*00(#)0000:0(0970000000$00090000-:.0:0000400*1,3009&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;8;;&lt;&lt;00.:+''0:;&lt;&lt;4
<p>
<p>
Where did you get the name?
<p>
<p>
iiley gave me the name when I asked for it.
<p>
Can I use your code?
<p>
<p>
Sure, it's in the bot jar file. Use it under the terms of the RWPCL.
<p>
What's next for your robot?
<p>
<p>
<UL >
<li> Fix movement glitches.
</UL>
<p>
Does it have any <a href="robowiki@WhiteWhales" class=wikipagelink>WhiteWhales</a>?
<p>
<p>
Not really.
<p>
What other robot(s) is it based on?
<p>
<p>
Swiffer, Tityus
