<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>The first publicly available bots were uploaded to the <a rel="nofollow"  Href="http://home.covad.net/~gchomuk/RoboCode/">Bot Exchange</a> beginning on August 17, 2001. The rules were slightly different, based entirely on survival, so most bots fired infrequently and some not at all. A deprecated method, getGunCharge<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=GunCharge" class=wikipageedit>?</a>(), was used for much firepower calculation, but merely confuses the old bots in the current Robocode.
<p>
Brute was the first upload. Based almost entirely on sample.Tracker, Brute had a primitive sort of radar locking. Unfortunately, Brute's gun was always turned perpendicular to its body and only fired when the gun was facing the opponent - which rarely happened.
<p>
Jazzbot followed a day later. Jazzbot got stuck on the walls alot, but wasn't as inept as Brute. Jazzbot used the following code to fire: <code>setTurnGunRight(normalRelativeAngle(e.getBearing() + (getHeading() - getRadarHeading()));</code>. It targetted bots who shot it when possible, and also had a "team mode." The next version of Jazzbot, had an intersting circular movement.
<p>
<a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a> was next, like the original Jazzbot, its movement was most similar to sample.Crazy. <a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a> had a complicated aiming system that allowed it to his sample.Walls. The aiming was basically linear, but inadequate by today's standards.
<p>
MarkVIII<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MarkVIII" class=wikipageedit>?</a> followed, it was less like the sample bots than the previous three, and had a leading aim that was not quite as good as <a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a>'s. It was also capable of beating all the sample bots in melee. StalkerI<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StalkerI" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, which came the same day, could beat the samples by today's rules if it always fired threes, but it didn't. Stalker was a modified and fairly successful Tracker except for a wall bug.
<p>
SmartBot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=SmartBot" class=wikipageedit>?</a> was the first bot of September '01 and did nothing productive, and StalkerIII<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StalkerIII" class=wikipageedit>?</a> was an upgrade from StalkerI<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=StalkerI" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. Two more upgrades followed: <a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a> 2 and Jazzbot4_1. Both used linear fire and had a sometimes locking radar. When both are always set to fire(3), the results are close, whereas if they are let to use their original fire control code, Jazzbot wins handidly. <a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a>'s movement was still crazy like, while Jazzbot's was an interesting version of Spinbot. <a href="robowiki@SquigBot" class=wikipagelink>SquigBot</a> was the better melee fighter of the two.
<p>
CoreBot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=CoreBot" class=wikipageedit>?</a> then became the first bot with multiple "cores" and an extendable framework. It was far bulkier than it would be today and had only two "cores." It was a wall rider in melee, and a rammer in 1vs1. Because of this, it usually finished 2nd in melee competitions. 
<p>
DeathSeeker<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=DeathSeeker" class=wikipageedit>?</a> was an effective tracker/rammer, it attacked its opponent while making quick pauses to change direction more effectively. BaseBot<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=BaseBot" class=wikipageedit>?</a> was released on the same day and wasn't very good. MovingDuck<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=MovingDuck" class=wikipageedit>?</a> was no better.
<p>
Rotator is possibly the most significant bot of the early collection. It had successful radar locking done with little code: 
<code>			
double theta=normalizeAngle(bearing-getRadarHeadingRadians());
if(theta&lt;0)
	setTurnRadarLeftRadians(10000);
else setTurnRadarRight(10000);
</code>
Of course, that could be easily reduced, but it was nevertheless small and very effective. Rotator would charge in at a 30 degree angle and then orbit around the opponent at roughly a 90 degree angle. Every successful bot today can be traced back to this concept.
<p>
The last two bots are inconsequential: KillerGorilla<a href="robowiki@action=edit&id=KillerGorilla" class=wikipageedit>?</a> got confused a lot, and Detector spun its gun around madly.
