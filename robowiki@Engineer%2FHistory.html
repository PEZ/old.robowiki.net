<p>
Version 0.5.2
<PRE >
 Haven't updated this in a while. In this version I changed the weighting system for the neurons and I also switch the 
 NN to use a single row of neurons rather than a grid.  
</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.4.1
<PRE >
 Rolled Back to 0.3.6 + changes.
 This version marks a big change. I have now fully implemented the Kohonen network; I had originally cut a few  
 features out for execution speed reasons. now I believe that I have worked out most of the issues, it's a bit slower
 than previous versions but not too much. I still have to tune it, but the network should now provide much better  
 classifications of inputs.

Version 0.4.0
<PRE >
 I havn't updated this page in a while. All versions between 0.3.3 and 0.4.0 have been mostly tweaks to various weights
 and parameters in the Kohonen Network. In this release I am experimenting with several new dimensions in the  
 classification vectors for the network that drives the gun. I also tweaked the gun's network to allow more nodes to 
 be created, which should result in more specific classifications.

Version 0.3.3
<PRE >
 I decided to switch my focus to the gun for a little while, as it is significantly weaker than the movement. 
 The gun in this version appears to be stronger than the previous version by a good bit, but the Rumble will tell for  
 sure.

Version 0.3.2
<PRE >
 fixed a few really stupid bugs in the surfing code, including a division by zero that sometimes happened when 
 smoothing the data.
 Rating: 2030
</PRE>

<p>
Version 0.3.1
<PRE >
 fixed a null pointer exception that occurred during close fighting.
 Rating: 2029
</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.3.0
<PRE >
 Added dynamic decisions for distancing based on enemy hit rates. I've been avoiding this because it seems like a 
 double-edged sword; it may help me avoid an enemy's gun, but now my gun will have to deal with different distances as
 well.

Version 0.2.9
<PRE >
 Rolled back to v. 0.2.5 and corrected a long-standing bug in the internal workings of the neural nets.
 Rating: 2030
</PRE>
<p>
<p>
Version 0.2.8
<PRE >
 I tried to increase the learning speed of the gun's network. Don't know how successful it will be in the Rumble 
 though.

Version 0.2.6:
<PRE >
 Tweaked the wall proximity dimesion in both the gun and the surfing.
 Made some changes to the classification vectors for the gun.
 Rating: 2029
</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.2.5:
<PRE >
 I've been visiting Europe for the past three weeks and had no access to <a href="robowiki@Robocode" class=wikipagelink>Robocode</a>, so this version 
 has only some small tweaks to the classification vectors while i re-learn my code.

</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.2.4:
<PRE >
 Changed the way that input vectors are blended with the node weighting vectors.
 Rating: 2027
</PRE>
<p>
<p>
Version 0.2.3:
<PRE >
 Changed the proximity formula to use normalized euclidean distance.
 Also this version is using a dynamically growing SOM, which is significantly faster.

<p>
Version 0.2.2:
<PRE >
 Fixed a wave bug I introduced accidentally in 0.2.1.
 Rating: 2026
</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.2.1:
<PRE >
 Some tweaks to the surfing weighting vectors as well as some performance optimization. If nothing else this version
 is faster to execute. 
 Rating: 2022
</PRE>
<p>
Version 0.2:
<PRE >
 Now using SOM for surfing as well. It needs to be tuned more, right now the surfing network is using the same
 weighting vectors as the gun's network.

Version 0.1:
<PRE >
 Initial release. Using Self Organizing Map for targeting and <a href="robowiki@PowerHouse" class=wikipagelink>PowerHouse</a>'s wavesurfing.
